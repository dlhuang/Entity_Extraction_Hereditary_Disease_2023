. O

One O
fallopian B-disease

diagnosed O

A O
prevalence O
of O
2.3 O
% O
occult B-disease
ovarian I-disease

was O
found O
by O
Rebbeck O

( O

Thus O
, O
a O
prevalence O
of O
2.3-18.5 O
% O
of O
occult B-disease
tumours I-disease
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
has O
been O
found O
. O

First O
, O
this O
wide O
range O
is O
probably O
attributable O
to O
the O
variable O
sizes O
of O
cohorts O
. O

Second O
, O
our O
finding O
of O
8.6 O
% O
prevalence O
of O
occult B-disease
tumours I-disease
is O
established O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
undergoing O
prophylactic O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
, O
while O
other O
series O
did O
not O
make O
a O
clear O
distinction O
between O
a O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
or O
an O
oophorectomy O
, O
nor O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

Third O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
ovarian B-disease
or I-disease
fallopian I-disease
tube I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
increases O
with O
age O
; O
so O
the O
low O
prevalence O
found O
by O
Rebbeck O
et O
al O
might O
be O
due O
to O
a O
lower O
mean O
age O
at O
prophylactic O
surgery O
. O

These O
studies O
show O
the O
importance O
of O
attentiveness O
of O
occult B-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
see O
that O
no O
occult B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
were O
found O
in O
our O
remaining O
group O
of O
women B-species
with O
either O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
or O
non-informative O
DNA O
test O
results O
. O

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
carriers O
of O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
have O
a O
substantial O
higher O
risk O
of O
occult B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
compared O
to O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
or O
non-informative O
test O
results O
. O

However O
, O
the O
power O
for O
the O
group O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
is O
still O
low O
. O

To O
estimate O
the O
prevalence O
of O
occult B-disease
fallopian I-disease
tube I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
at O
prophylactic O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
, O
we O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
distinguish O
both O
carcinomas O
, O
which O
is O
often O
not O
possible O
in O
advanced O
disease O
. O

In O
our O
series O
, O
two O
clear O
cases O
of O
fallopian B-disease
tube I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
and O
one O
fallopian B-disease
tube/ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
were O
found O
. O

In O
patient B-species
3 O
, O
the O
exact O
origin O
was O
not O
clear O
: O
the O
bulk O
of O
the O
tumour O
was O
seen O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
ovaries O
and O
both O
tubes O
. O

The O
histological O
subtype O
'poorly O
differentiated O
adenocarcinoma B-disease
' O
was O
also O
not O
helpful O
, O
since O
this O
cell O
type O
is O
associated O
with O
both O
tumours O
( O
Scully O
et O
al O
, O
2003 O
) O
. O

Zweemer O
et O
al O
( O
2000 O
) O
showed O
a O
loss O
of O
the O
wild-type O
BRCA1 B-gene
allele O
in O
two O
fallopian B-disease
tube I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
. O

In O
both O
patients B-species
, O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
was O
confirmed O
and O
a O
loss O
of O
the O
wild-type O
BRCA1 B-gene
allele O
in O
both O
tumours O
was O
shown O
. O

In O
our O
first O
patient B-species
, O
we O
used O
the O
same O
method O
and O
also O
found O
a O
LOH O
of O
the O
nonmutated O
BRCA1 B-gene
allele O
in O
the O
fallopian O
tube O
tissue O
. O

These O
findings O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
fallopian B-disease
tube I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
linked O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Paley O
et O

( O
2001 O
) O
described O
two O
patients B-species

one O
carcinoma B-disease

other O
patient B-species
with O
a O
papillary B-disease

the O

It O
was O
advised O
that O
hysterectomy O
should O
be O
discussed O
with O
patients B-species
who O
are O
considering O
prophylactic O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
no O
long-term O
data O
to O
support O
hysterectomy O
in O
addition O
to O
bilateral O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
just O
a O
few O
reports O
were O
published O
linking O
BRCA1 B-gene
and I-gene
2 I-gene
mutations O
with O
uterine B-disease
serous I-disease
papillary I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
( O
Hornreich O

, O
1999 O
; O
Lavie O
et O

) O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
hysterectomy O
has O
additional O
risks O
and O
complications O
( O
Dicker O
et O
al O
, O
1982 O
) O
. O

Given O
the O
anatomy O
, O
a O
hysterectomy O
can O
not O
prevent O
the O
development O
of O
PPSC B-disease
. O

Piver O
et O
al O
( O
1993 O
) O
described O
nine O
cases O
of O
PPSC B-disease
after O
abdominal O
total O
hysterectomy O
and O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
. O

All O
five O
occult B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
were O
discovered O
only O
at O
microscopical O
examination O
. O

Neither O
transvaginal O
examination O
nor O
serum O
CA-125 O
determination O
was O
sufficient O
enough O
to O
detect O
these O
malignancies O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
CA-125 O
and O
TVU O
was O
tested O
before O
in O
the O
general O
population O
( O
Jacobs O

Menon O
et O
al O
, O

) O
and O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
feasible O

method O
. O

However O
, O
failure O
to O
detect O
more O
than O
57 O
% O
of O
early-stage O
disease O
is O
cited O
as O
the O
major O
limitation O
of O
this O
type O
of O
screening O
( O
Jacobs O
et O
al O
, O
1993 O
) O
. O

More O

, O
by O

of O

examination O
, O
transvaginal O

and O
serum O
CA-125 O

. O

This O
high O
failure O
rate O
of O
ovarian O

stresses O
the O
importance O
of O
complete O
enclosure O
of O
both O

following O
prophylactic O
surgery O
in O
order O
not O
to O

the O

We O
agree O
with O
Colgan O
et O
al O
( O
2001 O
) O
who O
advised O
to O
entirely O
section O
both O
tubes O
and O
ovaries O
. O

Four O
of O

papillary B-disease
serous I-disease
peritoneal I-disease

of O
women B-species
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
were O
positive O
of O
P53 O

. O

These O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
results O
of O
Lakhani O
et O
al O
, O
who O
found O
that O
breast B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
in O
patients B-species
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
positive O
for O
p53 O
protein O
than O
controls O
. O

Among O
the O
38 O
patients B-species
who O
underwent O
a O
bilateral O
oophorectomy O
were O
26 O
BRCA1 B-gene

carriers O
, O
three O
of O
whom O
( O

The O
lack O
of O
PPSC B-disease
incidence O
in O
the O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
group O
including O
58 O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
( O
0 O
in O
60 O
in O
women-years O
) O
could O
well O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
difference O
in O
follow-up O
duration O
( O
45 O
months O
vs O
12 O
months O
in O
the O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
group O
, O
respectively O
) O
. O

Only O
10 O
women B-species
of O
the O
group O
with O
a O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
passed O
the O
time O
point O
at O
which O
the O
first O
PPSC B-disease
case O
occurred O
in O
the O
group O
of O
women B-species
with O
a O
bilateral O
oophorectomy O
. O

For O
a O
meaningful O
comparison O
between O
the O
two O
types O
of O
surgery O
, O
a O
longer O
follow-up O
is O
needed O
. O

Another O
explanation O
of O
the O
difference O
of O
PPSC B-disease
incidence O
may O
be O
that O
PPSC B-disease
could O
be O
a O
metastasis O
of O
the O
remnant O
fallopian O
tubes O
. O

However O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
PPSC B-disease
no O
malignant O
lesions O
were O
found O
in O
the O
fallopian O
tubes O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
PPSC B-disease
has O
developed O
after O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
( O
Piver O
et O
al O
, O
1993 O
) O
. O

So O
, O
we O
have O
concluded O
that O
PPSC B-disease
is O
a O
primary O
tumour O
and O
not O
a O
metastasis O
. O

Kauff O

The O

in O
our O
study O
( O
3.4 O

) O
was O
higher O
than O
the O
0.5 O
in O
100 O

, O
but O
this O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
longer O
mean O
follow-up O
duration O
( O
45 O

in O
our O

the O

for O
BRCA1 B-gene

who O
have O
a O
higher O

and O
this O
may O
also O
be O
true O
for O

only O
six O

The O
only O
report O
of O
PPSC B-disease

in O
two O
BRCA2 B-gene

Unfortunately O
, O
no O
data O

cases O

, O
but O
whether O
these O

not O
mentioned O
. O

Clearly O
, O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
conclude O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
face O
a O
lower O
risk O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
of O
developing O
PPSC B-disease
. O

These O
results O
contribute O
to O
the O
thesis O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
are O
not O
only O
at O
risk O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
but O
also O
for O
fallopian B-disease
tube I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
and O

Prophylactic O

is O
recommended O
in O
order O
to O
not O

Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
PPSC B-disease

lower O
than O

Introduction O
Male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
MBC B-disease

is O
a O
rare O
disease O
and O
little O
is O
known O
about O
its O
aetiology O
. O

However O
, O
female O
first-degree O
relatives O
of O
MBC B-disease
cases O
are O
at O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
there O
is O
an O
inherited O
component O
to O
the O
disease O
. O

Several O
genes O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
women B-species
have O
been O
identified O
during O
the O
past O
decade O
. O

One O
of O
these O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
to O
confer O
a O
significant O
risk O
of O

This O
equates O

The O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene

has O
been O

The O
estimated O

these O

at O

Discussion O
Our O
estimate O
of O
the O
familial O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
associated O
with O
a O
family O
history O
of O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
similar O
to O
other O
published O
estimates O
. O

However O
, O
our O
estimate O
is O
based O
on O
a O
reported O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
that O
was O
not O
independently O
confirmed O
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
a O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
generally O
accurately O
reported O
by O
women B-species
, O
but O
it O
may O
be O
less O
accurate O
for O
men B-species
, O
for O
whom O
some O
degree O
of O
under-reporting O
is O
likely O
. O

This O
may O
result O
in O
an O
underestimate O
of O
the O
familial O
risk O
. O

As O
with O
other O
studies O
, O
we O
found O
no O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
in O
our O
case O
series O
. O

The O
carrier O
frequency O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
was O
6 O
% O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
= O
2-13 O
% O
) O
, O
which O
is O
broadly O
comparable O
with O
that O
of O
previous O
estimates O
, O
but O
likely O
to O
be O
an O
underestimate O
of O
the O
true O
carrier O
frequency O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
of O
the O
missense O
variants O
that O
we O
identified O
may O
disrupt O
the O
protein O
structure O
substantially O
, O
but O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
good O
functional O
assay O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
these O
variants O
were O
not O
classified O
as O
disease O
causing O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
SSCP/HA O
is O
known O
to O
be O
less O
than O
100 O
% O
, O
and O
for O
nonsense O
mutations O
may O
be O
as O
low O
as O
50 O
% O
. O

Finally O
, O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
which O
will O
not O
be O
identified O
by O
PCR-based O
mutation O
detection O
methods O
are O
known O
to O
occur O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

A O
study O
combining O
linkage O
and O
mutation O
data O
in O
multiple O
case O
families O
has O
estimated O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
mutation O
detection O
techniques O
for O
these O
genes O
to O
be O
approximately O
70 O
% O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
sensitivity O
, O
the O
frequency O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
this O
series O
could O
be O
as O
high O
as O
8 O
% O
. O

Survival O
bias O
may O
also O
affect O
the O
estimate O
of O
carrier O
mutation O
frequency O
. O

The O
participants B-species
in O
this O
study O
were O
prevalent O
cases O
and O
carrier O
frequency O
may O
be O
either O
underestimated O
or O
overestimated O
if O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
associated O
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carries O
a O
different O
prognosis O
from O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
men B-species
without O
a O
mutation O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
no O
published O
data O
on O
outcome O
in O
BRCA-associated O
MBC B-disease
, O
and O
in O
women B-species
the O
effect O
of O
BRCA B-gene
status O
on O
outcome O
is O
not O
clear O
. O

The O
risk O
of O
female B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
thought O
to O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O
location O
of O
mutations O
throughout O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
. O

Mutations O
in O

associated O
with O
either O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease

, O
a O

of O
breast B-disease

, O
or O
a O
combination O
of O
both O
, O
compared O
with O

in O

Figure O

the O

BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
identified O

this O
and O
other O

This O
illustrates O
that O
there O
appears O
to O
be O
no O
clustering O
of O
mutations O
that O
would O
indicate O
a O
genotype-phenotype O
correlation O
analogous O
to O
that O
observed O
for O
female B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Our O
data O
show O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
accounts O
for O
only O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
the O
excess O
familial O
risk O
of O
female B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
associated O
with O
MBC B-disease

, O
of O
which O
only O

Thus O
, O
allowing O
for O
a O

70 O
% O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
accounts O
for O
approximately O
15 O

. O

Conclusion O
The O
majority O
of O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
not O
accounted O
for O
by O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene

and O
these O

account O
for O
only O
15 O
% O
of O
the O
excess O
familial O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
female O

This O

that O

an O

However O
, O
the O

The O
function O

Choosing O
candidate O
SNPs O
or O
genes O
to O
evaluate O
as O
modifiers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
suffers O
from O
the O
same O
problem O
faced O
by O
all O
candidate-based O
genetic O
association O
studies O
, O
namely O
the O
poor O
understanding O
of O
the O
relevant O
pathways O
and O
hence O
the O
small O
a O
priori O
likelihood O
that O
any O
of O
them O
are O
true O
modifiers O
. O

These O
issues O
may O
be O
overcome O
in O
the O
future O
through O
the O
identification O
of O
candidate O
genomic O
regions O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease

by O

, O
or O
more O
plausibly O
by O
the O
identification O
of O
candidate O

by O
adequately O

the O

Statistical O
considerations O
Most O
association O
studies O
are O
case-control O
studies O
, O
in O
which O
genotype O
frequencies O
in O
a O
series O
of O
cases O
are O
compared O
with O
those O
in O
series O
of O
controls O
. O

The O
analysis O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
modifiers O
is O
potentially O
more O
complex O
, O
because O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
carriers O
become O
affected O
. O

Thus O
, O
modifiers O
would O
be O
expected O
to O
influence O
not O
just O
whether O
a O
carrier O
became O
affected O
but O
also O
the O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
. O

More O
powerful O
analyses O
can O
, O
therefore O
, O
be O
conducted O
by O
treating O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
as O
a O
survival O
( O
age O
at O
onset O
) O
rather O
than O
a O
simple O
binary O
endpoint O
. O

An O
additional O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
introduced O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
mutation O
carriers O
are O
mainly O
ascertained O
through O
cancer O
genetics O
clinics O
. O

In O
these O
settings O
, O
the O
first O
tested O
individual O
in O
a O
family O
is O
usually O
someone O
diagnosed O
with O
cancer O
at O
a O
relatively O
young O
age O
. O

Such O
study O
designs O
tend O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
lead O
to O
an O
over-sampling O
of O
affected O
individuals O
and O
standard O
analytical O
methods O
like O
Cox O
regression O
may O
lead O
to O
biased O
estimates O
of O
the O
risk O
ratios O
. O

CIMBA O
aims O
to O
address O
this O
potential O
bias O
by O
using O
standard O
analytical O
methods O
, O
such O
as O
weighted O
Cox O
regression O
, O
or O
by O
analyzing O
the O
data O
within O
a O
retrospective O
likelihood O
framework O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
analyses O
restricted O
to O
incident O
cases O
, O
defined O
as O

with O
cancer O
no O
more O
than O
five O

prior O
to O
ascertainment O
, O
are O
applied O
to O
account O
in O
part O
for O
ascertainment O
and O
possible O
survival O
bias O
. O

One O
of O
the O
aims O
of O
CIMBA O
is O
also O
to O
further O
develop O
the O
statistical O
methodology O
used O
to O
analyze O
such O
data O
. O

Among O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
and O
at O
a O
threshold O
of O
p O
< O
0.0001 O
, O
CIMBA O
currently O
has O
a O
power O
of O
over O
80 O
% O
to O
detect O
polymorphisms O
with O
minor O

that O

. O

The O
power O
is O
somewhat O
lower O
among O
the O

. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
far O
greater O
than O
the O
power O
that O
be O
achieved O
by O
each O

at O
a O
minor O

of O
20 O
% O

the O

would O
be O
< O
5 O

Prevalence O

Prevalence O

These O

confirm O
that O
clinical O
characteristics O
such O
as O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
family O
, O
age O

number O

The O
overall O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1-2 B-gene
mutations O
among O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
from O
the O
entire O
Sardinia O
was O
quite O
similar O
to O
that O
previously O
reported O
for O
breast-ovarian B-disease

from O
the O
Northern O

of O
the O

, O
15 O

However O
prevalence O

higher O
in O

When O
compared O
to O
many O
other O
Italian O
and O
European O
studies O
, O
the O
frequency O
is O
relatively O
low O
. O

Since O
the O
sensitivity O

methods O
is O
not O
complete O
, O
some O
mutations O
may O

a O
fraction O
of O

Overall O

even O
considering O
a O
lack O
of O

used O
in O
the O

the O

this O

, O
may O
somehow O
explain O
this O
low O

, O
though O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
exclude O
that O

a O

Noteworthy O
, O
a O

Interestingly O
, O
in O

Altogether O
, O

that O

The O

In O
this O

were O
more O

although O
it O
should O
be O

that O

in O

the O
histological O

this O

We O
present O
the O

in O
the O
first O

with O

were O
collected O
from O

in O
England O

. O

The O

by O

, O
stage O
and O
serum O

Following O

re-grading O
according O
to O
current O
conventional O
criteria O
, O
Gleason O
scores O
of O
PRCA B-disease

9 O
or O

, O
P=0.012 O

than O
those O
in O

Since O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

carrier O
status O
is O
associated O
with O
more O
aggressive O
disease O
, O
it O
is O
a O

factor O

. O

Targeting O

this O
population O
may O
detect O

at O

which O
may O
therefore O
be O

Prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
PRCA B-disease
) O
is O
the O
most O
commonly O
diagnosed O
malignancy O
in O
men B-species
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
. O

It O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
composed O
of O
aggressive O
and O
indolent O
varieties O
. O

Indolent O
PRCA B-disease
may O
exist O
for O
many O
years O
without O
causing O
symptoms O
or O
shortening O
life O
expectancy O
. O

Aggressive O
PRCA B-disease
may O
cause O
symptoms O
difficult O
to O
palliate O
with O
conventional O
treatments O
and O
is O
likely O
to O
shorten O
life O
expectancy O
. O

Distinguishing O
which O
men B-species
are O
at O
risk O
of O
which O
types O
of O
disease O
could O
have O
far-reaching O
consequences O
not O
only O
in O

of O

also O
in O

This O
test O
looks O
for O
differences O

It O
is O
based O
on O
the O
idea O
that O
if O
there O
are O
really O
no O
differences O
in O
the O
Gleason O
scores O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

, O
then O
any O
differences O
in O
our O

must O
have O
arisen O

are O
equally O
likely O
to O
occur O

Therefore O
, O
if O
there O
were O

, O
we O
would O
expect O
the O

DISCUSSION O
We O
have O
reported O
the O
histopathology O
found O
in O
the O
first O
UK O
series O
of O
male O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
PRCA B-disease
. O

The O
men B-species
who O
carry O
the O
mutations O
have O
a O
diverse O
heritage O
( O
consistent O
with O
our O
population O
) O
; O
as O
such O
our O
series O
is O
not O
confined O
to O
a O
few O
founder O
mutations O
. O

The O
number O
of O
PRCAs B-disease
with O
Gleason O
score O
8 O
, O
9 O
or O
10 O
is O
significantly O
greater O
in O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
group O
than O
that O
in O
the O
control O
group O
( O
P=0.012 O
) O
. O

This O
difference O
is O
also O
seen O
between O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
alone O
and O
the O
matched O
control O
group O
( O
P=0.016 O
) O
. O

These O
findings O
would O
support O
studies O
that O
suggest O
that O
male O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
who O
develop O
PRCA B-disease
may O
have O
a O
shorter O
disease-specific O
life O
expectancy O
than O
men B-species
with O
PRCA B-disease
in O
the O
general O
population O

The O
Breast O

has O
conducted O
a O
large O
prospective O

It O
demonstrated O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene

have O
a O
relative O
risk O
( O
RR O
) O
of O
PRCA B-disease
of O
4.65 O
rising O
to O
7.33 O
below O
the O
age O
of O
65 O
years O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
an O
RR O
of O
PRCA B-disease
of O
1.82 O
under O
the O
age O
of O
65 O
years O

data O
have O
been O
recorded O
in O
the O
AJ O

) O
, O
although O
smaller O
clinical O
studies O
have O
generally O
not O
demonstrated O
an O
increased O
frequency O
of O
founder O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
among O
Jewish O
men B-species
with O
PRCA B-disease

In O
the O
current O
data O
set O
, O
six O
men B-species
were O
identified O
from O
a O
previous O
study O
conducted O
at O
The O
Institute O
of O
Cancer O
Research O
, O
as O
described O
in O
the O
Materials O
and O
Methods O
section O
. O

As O
these O
men B-species
were O
selected O
for O
mutation O
analysis O
following O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
young O
onset O
PRCA B-disease
, O
this O
data O
set O
is O
skewed O
for O
young O
age O
and O
so O
the O
controls O
have O
been O
matched O
for O
age O
. O

The O
median O
age O
of O
PRCA B-disease
diagnosis O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
is O
52.5 O
years O
and O
in O
the O
matched O
control O
group O
it O
is O
55.5 O
years O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
these O
two O
age O
groups O
is O
not O
significant O
, O
but O
the O
age O
of O
onset O
in O
these O
groups O
is O
considerably O
less O
than O
the O
average O
age O
of O
onset O
of O
PRCA B-disease
in O
the O
UK O
general O
population O
( O
75 O
years O
) O
( O
www.statistics.gov.uk O
) O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
PRCA B-disease
in O
a O
young O
age O
group O
may O
show O
a O
different O
histopathology O
to O
that O
in O
an O
older O
age O
group O
. O

However O
, O
the O
controls O
were O
matched O
for O
age O
and O
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
significantly O
lower O
Gleason O
score O
. O

Prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
incidence O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
higher O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
under O
the O
age O
of O
65 O
years O
( O
BCLC O
, O
1999 O
; O
Thompson O
et O
al O
, O
2002 O
) O
. O

If O
these O
carriers O
do O
develop O
more O
aggressive O
disease O
at O
a O
younger O
age O
than O
the O
general O
population O
, O
then O
screening O
them O
for O
PRCA B-disease
may O
be O
a O
prudent O
use O
of O
resources O
. O

Matching O
the O
cases O
to O
the O
control O
group O
was O
not O
always O
straightforward O
. O

Prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
dedifferentiates O
over O

( O

. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
to O
match O
men B-species
who O
may O
or O
may O
not O
have O
had O
the O
disease O
in O

for O
differing O

To O
minimise O
such O

, O
the O
men B-species
in O
the O
control O
group O
were O
matched O
for O

. O

This O
produced O

, O
as O

be O
missing O
, O
the O
controls O
were O
chosen O
with O
advanced O
stage O
and O
with O
a O
serum O
PSA O
level O
higher O
than O
100 O
ng O
ml-1 O
. O

This O
was O
done O
in O
order O
to O
bias O
the O
control O
group O
towards O
more O
advanced O
disease O
and O
therefore O
with O
potential O
for O
dedifferentiation O
to O
a O
more O
aggressive O
Gleason O
pattern O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
effect O
that O
we O
have O
reported O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
is O
probably O
greater O
in O
reality O
. O

Similarly O
, O
it O
could O
be O
argued O
that O
men B-species
who O
present O
with O
symptomatic O
disease O
could O
have O
a O
more O
advanced O
natural O
history O
than O
those O
men B-species
who O
present O
with O
screen-detected O
disease O
( O
Draisma O
et O
al O
, O
2006 O
) O
. O

In O
this O
series O
of O
men B-species
, O
the O
controls O
have O
been O
carefully O
chosen O
so O
that O
they O
have O
presented O
with O
symptoms O
more O
often O
than O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
group O
. O

In O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
series O
, O
the O
control O
group O
only O
presented O
with O
screen-detected O
disease O
in O
four O
men B-species
, O
whereas O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
cases O
presented O
with O
symptomatic O
disease O
once O
. O

A O
more O
difficult O
variable O
for O
which O
to O
correct O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
series O
of O
cases O
and O
controls O
uses O
data O
from O
a O
variety O
of O
sources O
, O
including O
prostate O
biopsies O
, O
TURPs O
and O
prostatectomies O
for O
comparison O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
patients B-species
in O
this O
series O
had O
sextant O
biopsies O
( O
Hodge O
et O
al O
, O
1989 O
) O
. O

Reports O
have O
suggested O
that O
needle O
biopsy O
and O
radical O
prostatectomy O
Gleason O
scores O
only O
match O
in O
45 O
% O
of O
cases O
( O
Bostwick O
, O
1994 O
; O
Levine O
et O
al O
, O
1998 O
; O
King O
et O
al O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
to O
result O
from O
intraobserver O
and O
interobserver O
variability O
in O
Gleason O
grading O
and O
sampling O
error O
in O
taking O
the O
biopsy O
. O

Ozdamar O
et O
al O
( O
1996 O
) O
showed O
that O
grading O
error O
was O
greatest O
with O
well-differentiated O
( O
Gleason O
scores O
2-4 O
) O
tumours O
. O

In O
these O
cases O
, O
the O
accuracy O
was O
only O
15 O
% O
with O
needle O
biopsy O
( O
Ozdamar O
et O
al O
, O
1996 O
) O
. O

Of O
patients B-species
with O
Gleason O
scores O
5-7 O
on O
needle O
biopsy O
, O
97 O
% O
were O
graded O
correctly O
. O

All O
those O
with O
Gleason O
scores O
8-10 O
on O
needle O
biopsy O
were O
graded O
correctly O
. O

Deshmukh O
and O
Foster O
( O
1998 O
) O
argue O
that O
some O
pathologists O
do O
not O
identify O
milder O
forms O
of O
grade O
3 O
PRCA B-disease
and O
label O
it O
instead O
as O
grade O
2 O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
no O
PRCAs B-disease
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
Gleason O
score O
less O
than O
6 O
. O

There O
is O
also O
discordance O
in O
the O
reporting O
of O
Gleason O
scores O
among O
pathologists O
( O
Allsbrook O
et O
al O
, O
2001a O
) O
. O

This O
is O
, O
however O
, O
significantly O
less O
between O
specialist O
urological O
pathologists O
( O
Allsbrook O
et O
al O
, O
2001b O
) O
. O

Both O
CJ O
and O
CSF O
are O
specialist O
urological O
pathologists O
. O

Recently O
, O
these O
criteria O
have O
been O
used O
to O
assess O
a O
large O
number O
of O
PRCAs B-disease
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
and O
to O
resolve O
discrepancies O
( O
Berney O
et O
al O
, O
2007a O
, O
2007b O
) O
. O

Risk O
of O
interobserver O
variability O
was O
further O
minimised O
in O
this O
study O
by O
having O
CJ O
review O
a O
subset O
of O
the O
cases O
and O
controls O
; O
there O
was O
no O
discordance O
between O
the O
two O
histopathologists O
. O

Of O
the O
16 O
controls O
for O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
series O
, O
14 O
had O
not O
been O
tested O
for O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

Edwards O
et O
al O
( O
2003 O
) O
found O
that O
the O
incidence O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
in O
early-onset O
PRCA B-disease
sufferers O
( O
under O
the O
age O
of O
55 O
years O
) O
could O
be O
as O
high O
as O
3.0 O
% O
( O
Edwards O
et O
al O
, O
2003 O
) O
. O

The O
average O
age O
of O
our O
control O
group O
was O
55.5 O
years O
, O
so O
we O
would O
expect O
that O
at O
most O
one O
of O
these O
men B-species
could O
have O
harboured O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
this O
data O
set O
is O
the O
first O
UK O
series O
of O
male O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
PRCA B-disease
. O

These O
mutation O
carriers O
have O
a O
significantly O
higher O
Gleason O
score O
than O
the O
non-carriers O
with O
PRCA B-disease
. O

It O
would O
follow O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
therefore O
prognostic O
markers O
for O
aggressive O
PRCA B-disease
. O

If O
screening O
for O
PRCA B-disease
using O
serum O
PSA O
detects O
malignant O
disease O
at O
an O
earlier O
stage O
, O
this O
may O
have O
the O
potential O
to O
reduce O
mortality O
from O
a O
histologically O
aggressive O
disease O
in O
this O
population O
. O

These O
data O
would O
support O

Although O

, O
the O
BRCA1-185delAG O
was O
associated O
with O

. O

These O
findings O
should O
be O
carefully O
considered O
in O
genetic O
counseling O
and/or O
evaluating O
therapeutic O
options O
. O

Prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
commonly O
diagnosed O
solid O
tumor O
and O
the O
second O
leading O
cause O
of O
cancer O
deaths O
among O
men B-species
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

Although O
the O
etiology O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
poorly O
understood O
, O
a O
large O
twin O
study O
has O
estimated O
that O
42 O
% O
of O
disease O
variation O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
genetic O
factors O
and O
58 O
% O
to O
environmental/lifestyle O
factors O
. O

Moreover O
, O
one O
of O
the O
strongest O
risk O
factors O
for O
this O
disease O
is O
a O
family O
history O
of O
prostate B-disease

; O
having O
a O
first-degree O
relative O

with O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
associated O
with O
a O
2- O
to O
3-fold O
elevation O
in O
the O
relative O
risk O
( O
RR O
) O
, O
and O
both O
early O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
and O
multiple O
affected O
family O
members O
are O
strong O
predictors O
of O
risk O
in O

. O

Taken O
together O
, O
these O
results O
suggest O
a O
strong O
inherited O
component O
to O
disease O
risk O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
attempts O
to O
identify O
`` O
high-risk O
'' O
genes O
with O
a I-disease
dominant O
mode O
of O
inheritance O
, O
such O
as O
APC B-gene
for O
colon B-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
VHL B-gene
for O
renal B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
have O
been O
unsuccessful O
for O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Recent O
genome-wide O
association O
studies O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
have O
identified O
a O
number O
of O
loci O
and O
genetic O
variants O
that O
individually O
contribute O
to O
a O
small O
increase O
in O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
( O
- O
) O
but O
still O
do O
not O
explain O
the O
familial O
risk O
of O
this O
cancer O

Of O
the O
known O
cancer O
susceptibility O
genes O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene

have O
been O
candidate O

studies O
of O
populations O
who O
harbor O
founder O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene

( O

suggest O
that O
men B-species

have O
an O

risk O
( O

) O
of O
prostate B-disease

( O
2- O
to O

. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
protein-truncating O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
. O

Unlike O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
have O
been O
inconsistently O
associated O
with O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

Several O
epidemiologic O
studies O
that O
have O
examined O
the O
risk O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carries O
have O
reported O
small O
, O
but O
not O
statistically O
significant O
, O
or O
null O
results O
. O

However O
, O
one O
of O
the O
challenges O
of O
epidemiologic O
studies O
that O
examine O
the O
role O
of O
disease-associated O
mutations O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
to O
the O
susceptibility O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
such O
mutations O
in O
the O
general O
population O
is O
rare O
. O

One O
ethnic O
population O
that O
has O
been O
used O
to O
examine O
the O
associations O
between O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
Ashkenazim B-species
because O
~2.0 O

of O
this O

at O

one O
of O
3 O

, O
and O

) O
in O
these O
2 O
genes O
. O

A O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
examined O
the O
role O
of O
these O
mutations O
in O
relation O
to O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
( O
- O
) O
. O

Results O
of O
these O
studies O
have O
been O
inconsistent O
largely O
due O
to O
small O
sample O
sizes O
or O
lack O
of O
covariate O
information O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
some O
studies O
reported O
associations O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
whereas O
others O
have O

To O

the O
associations O

the O
three O

conducted O
a O

study O
of O
prostate B-disease

among O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
men B-species

In O

we O

The O
age O

indicates O
that O
the O
former O

is O
still O
at O
risk O
for O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
as O
they O
transit O
to O
older O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
founder O
mutations O
decreased O
with O
age O
in O
controls O
, O
which O
in O
part O
can O
explain O
the O
positive O
association O
observed O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene

and O
prostate B-disease

in O

In O
this O
study O
, O
the O
observed O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene

declined O

Similarly O

reported O
a O

in O
the O

D.C. O
study O
in O

. O

Our O
study O
has O
strengths O
and O
limitations O
. O

We O
originally O
estimated O
that O
a O
sample O
size O
of O
1,800 O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
men B-species
would O
be O
sufficient O
to O
detect O
a O
2-fold O
increase O
in O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
with O
an O
accumulated O
mutation O
frequency O
of O
2.0 O
% O
based O
on O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
population O
. O

Men B-species
were O
recruited O
using O
a O
novel O
strategy O
of O
recruitment O
by O
advertisement O
and O
were O
requested O
to O
provide O
all O
materials O
through O
the O
mail O
. O

As O
presented O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
over O
75 O
% O
of O
the O
study O
population O
had O
at O
least O
a O
college O
degree O
that O
facilitated O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
self-administered O
questionnaire O
and O
self-obtained O
DNA O
sample O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
most O
cases O
provided O
their O
own O
pathology O
reports O
significantly O
reducing O
the O
labor O
involved O
in O
obtaining O
medical O
records O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
such O
a O
recruitment O
strategy O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
introduce O
bias O
into O
the O
study O
sample O
. O

Therefore O
, O
these O
data O
should O
be O
interpreted O
in O
light O
of O
this O
recruitment O
strategy O
. O

Despite O
this O
fact O
, O
the O
data O
in O
Table O
1 O
provide O
reassurance O
that O
not O
only O
were O
our O
cases O
comparable O
with O
controls O
with O
respect O
to O
demographic O
characteristics O
, O
but O
we O
also O
show O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
three O
founder O
mutations O
in O
our O
study O
is O
similar O
to O
other O
large O
studies O
conducted O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
population O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
collected O
detailed O
information O
on O
family O
history O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
other O
cancers O
, O
as O
well O
as O
covariates O
that O
are O
important O
in O
understanding O
the O
association O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
report O
is O
the O
first O
large O
study O
in O
men B-species
of O
Ashkenazi O
descent O
that O
recruited O
both O
cases O
and O
controls O
and O
did O
not O
depend O
on O
previous O
control O
cohorts O
to O
calculate O
the O
association O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Because O
only O
1 O
% O
of O
cases O
and O
controls O
were O
< O
50 O
years O
old O
, O
we O
had O
limited O
power O
to O
examine O
associations O
with O
very O
early O
ages O
at O
diagnosis O
and O
thus O
our O
findings O
are O
relevant O
to O
men B-species
diagnosed O
with O
this O
disease O
at O
age O
> O
=50 O
years O
. O

Lastly O
, O
there O
was O
an O
average O
5-year O
lag O
time O
between O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
and O
participation O
in O
the O
study O
among O
cases O
, O
which O
represents O
a O
challenge O
in O
assessing O
the O
role O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
incident O
versus O
prevalent O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

To O
address O
this O
issue O
, O
we O
adjusted O
the O
analysis O
for O
age O
at O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
for O
cases O
and O
age O
at O
participation O
for O
controls O
. O

When O
we O
restricted O
our O
analyses O
to O
cases O
that O
were O
recruited O
in O
the O
study O
within O
a O
5-year O
period O
after O
their O
cancer O
diagnosis O
( O
n O
= O
595 O
) O
, O
the O
associations O
between O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutations O
and O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
were O
similar O
to O
those O
observed O
using O
the O
entire O
case O
group O
( O
n O
= O
979 O
) O
. O

Although O
the O
overall O
5-year O
survival O
rate O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
98 O
% O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
incident O
cases O
are O
still O
alive O
10 O
years O
after O
their O
cancer O
diagnosis O
, O
we O
can O
not O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
some O
cases O
diagnosed O
with O
more O
advanced O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
had O
subsequently O
died O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
were O
not O
part O
of O
this O
study O
population O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
given O
the O
3.2-fold O
increased O
risk O
of O
high O
Gleason O
score O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
associated O
with O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
founder O
mutation O
in O
this O
study O
, O
if O
men B-species
with O
high O
Gleason O
score O
( O
- O
) O
died O
before O
study O
participation O
, O
then O
our O
findings O
reflect O
an O
underestimate O
of O
the O
true O
association O
between O
BRCA2 B-gene
founder O
mutation O
and O
high O
Gleason O
score O
cancer O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
results O
of O
this O
study O
indicate O
that O
protein-truncating O
founder O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
confer O
a O
3-fold O
increased O
RR O
of O
high O
Gleason O
score O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Although O
the O
two O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
taken O
together O
were O
not O
associated O
with O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
-185delAG O
was O
associated O
with O
high O
Gleason O
score O
cancer O
. O

Associations O
between O
founder O
mutations O
and O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
were O
stronger O
in O
men B-species
with O
no O
first-degree O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
but O
were O
unaffected O
by O
family O
history O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

These O
findings O
highlight O
the O
importance O
of O
founder O
mutations O
, O
particularly O
those O
located O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene

, O
in O
susceptibility O

This O

was O
not O

given O
the O
strong O

the O

that O

Hence O
, O
the O

Introduction O
Breast B-disease

is O
the O
most O
common O

in O
women B-species

In O
5 O
% O
to O
10 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease

cases O
, O
the O
disease O
results O
from O
a O
hereditary O
predisposition O
, O
which O
can O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
be O
attributed O
to O
mutations O
in O
either O
of O
two O
tumour O
suppressor O
genes O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
MIM O

These O

as O

. O

Women B-species
carrying O
pathogenic O
germline O
mutations O
in O
either O
of O
these O
genes O
tend O
to O
develop O
breast B-disease

at O
an O
early O
age O
. O

The O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
encode O
large O
proteins O
of O
1,863 O
and O
3,418 O
amino O
acids O
, O
respectively O
. O

Over O
300 O
distinct O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
been O
described O
. O

These O
mutations O
are O
widely O
scattered O
across O
both O
genes O
and O
most O
affect O
the O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
the O
gene O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
a O
significant O
proportion O
( O
34 O
% O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene

38 O
% O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
) O
( O
http O

) O
are O
missense O
mutations O
that O
alter O
one O
amino O

but O
do O
not O
truncate O
the O

and O
are O

Moreover O

Hence O
the O
biggest O
challenge O
in O
interpreting O
the O
mutation O
analysis O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
is O
to O
distinguish O
between O
harmless O

and O

mutations O
associated O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
mutations O
specific O
for O
certain O
populations O
and O
ethnic O
groups O
have O
been O

in O
both O
genes O

For O

, O

BRCA1 B-gene

reported O
for O

The O

both O

the O

However O
, O

possibly O
an O
important O
alteration O
since O
a O
positively O

which O
may O
have O
an O

Another O
potentially O

concerns O
p.Thr1852Ile B-mutation

where O
the O

The O

they O

the O

The O

c.5313-31A B-mutation

also O
deserves O
further O

as O
it O

, O
the O

so O

p.Lys3326X B-mutation
( O
c.10204A B-mutation

is O
probably O

. O

Since O
the O

is O
at O
the O
very O

the O

, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O

Thus O
, O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
truncating O
mutation O
on O
cancer O
predisposition O
remains O
unclear O
. O

The O
p.Val950Ile B-mutation
may O
not O
be O
a O
significant O
change O
as O
both O

belong O
to O
the O

, O
hydrophobic O

However O
, O
p B-mutation
Gln609Glu I-mutation
and O
p.Gln699Leu B-mutation
are O
potentially O
important O
alterations O
as O
for O

of O
the O

the O

The O

mutation O
p.Leu1209Val B-mutation
lies O
in O
the O
conserved O
region O
of O
exon O
11 O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
as O
the O
sequence O

whereas O

not O

the O

) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
even O
tough O
the O

may O
not O
give O
any O
effect O

amino O

As O

quite O
low O

Although O

we O
still O
believe O
that O
Glutamine O

may O
have O
an O
effect O

protein O
conformation O
as O
two O

the O

Although O

these O

It O
was O
initially O
suggested O
that O
the O

would O
be O
responsible O
for O
most O
cases O

inherited B-disease

, O
but O
more O
recent O
studies O
suggest O
that O
they O
would O
account O
for O
a O
far O
smaller O
proportion O
, O
with O
considerable O
variation O
among O
different O
populations O
. O

We O
found O
that O
the O
incidence O
of O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
varies O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
diagnostic O
group O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O

were O

( O

. O

The O
proportion O
of O
families O
affected O
by O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
depends O
on O
the O
population O
analyzed O
and O
on O
the O
criteria O
used O
to O
select O
the O
patients B-species
. O

Family O
history O
of O

was O
, O
however O
, O
absent O

not O
suggestive O

a O

in O

of O
the O

and O
in O
more O

This O
suggests O
that O

screening O

only O
would O
miss O
a O
considerable O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a O
relatively O
high O
percentage O
of O
early O

Indonesian O
breast B-disease

carry O
a O

Several O
novel O

BRCA1 B-gene

It O
is O

Discussion O
and O
conclusion O
Breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
carrying O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutations O
often O
occur O
in O
younger O
women B-species
as O
well O
as O
present O
a O
high O
tumour O
grade O
and/or O
lack O
of O
expression O
of O
estrogen/progesterone O
receptors O
( O
mostly O
, O
among O
BRCA1-positive O
tumours O
) O
. O

Although O
these O
features O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
a O
poor O
prognosis O
, O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
occurrence O
of O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
and O
the O
effect O
on O
overall O
survival O
is O
still O
controversial O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
clarify O
the O
role O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
from O
North O
Sardinia O
, O
where O
an O
official O
cancer O
registry O
is O
available O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
5-year O
survival O
rates O
among O
women B-species
who O
had O
received O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
from O
1997 O
to O
2002 O
and O
gave O
their O
consent O
to O
undergo O
a O
BRCA B-gene
genetic O
testing O
. O

Among O
the O
508 O
analyzed O
patients B-species
, O
we O
assessed O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer-specific O
survival O
rates O
for O
women B-species
with O
( O
44 O
cases O
; O
9 O
% O
) O
or O
without O
( O
464 O
cases O
; O
91 O
% O
) O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
. O

Using O
the O
Kaplan-Meier O
method O
, O
the O
survival O
rate O
of O
patients B-species
with O
a O
positive O
BRCA2 B-gene
genetic O
test O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
patients B-species
with O
negative O
genetic O
tests O
within O
the O
first O
two O
years O
after O
diagnosis O
in O
our O
series O
. O

However O
, O
the O
two O
survival O
curves O
tended O
to O
merge O
at O
the O
end O
of O
five O
years O
from O
diagnosis O
( O
see O
Figure O
1 O
) O
. O

This O
trend O
may O
indeed O
account O
for O
the O
absence O
of O
significance O
of O
the O
Cox O
regression O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
status O
, O
due O
to O
the O
failure O
of O
proportionality O
of O
hazards O
( O
a O
situation O
in O
which O
calculation O
of O
a O
total O
hazard O
ratio O
with O
the O
Cox O
model O
is O
unsuitable O
) O
. O

The O
relative O
survival O
of O
the O
entire O
Sardinian O
series O
at O
five O
years O
from O
diagnosis O
is O
slightly O
below O
the O
average O
survival O
rate O
observed O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
from O
the O
other O
Italian O
regions O
; O
moreover O
, O
it O
always O
remains O
lower O
in O
the O
subset O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
than O
in O
that O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation-negative O
patients B-species
, O
regardless O
the O
adjustments O
according O
to O
the O
different O
prognostic O
parameters O
in O
multivariate O
analysis O
( O
see O
Figures O
2 O
and O
3 O
) O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
relative O
survival O
seems O
to O
be O
worse O
in O
cases O
with O
positive O
BRCA2 B-gene
genetic O
tests O
, O
even O
after O
adjustment O
for O
age O
of O
onset O
( O
which O
represents O
one O
of O
the O
factors O
with O
the O
greatest O
influence O
on O
cancer O
prognosis O
, O
according O
to O
the O
studies O
in O
other O
populations O
) O
. O

Although O
survival O
is O
also O
deeply O
influenced O
by O
disease O
stage O
at O
the O
time O
of O
diagnosis O
, O
we O
observed O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
BRCA2 B-gene
subsets O
after O
stratification O
by O
stage O
. O

Although O
our O
study O
has O
a O
number O
of O
limitations O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
identified O
only O
a O
limited O
fraction O
( O
44/508 O
; O
9 O
% O
) O
of O
mutation O
carriers O
and O
, O
thus O
, O
the O
subgroup O
analyses O
relied O
on O
a O
small O
number O
of O
subjects O
, O
we O
can O
conclude O
that O
a O
prolonged O
follow-up O
observation O
seems O
to O
minimize O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutations O
on O
prognosis O
among O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
from O
Sardinian O
population O
. O

Our O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
data O
recently O
reported O
in O
Israeli O
women B-species
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
ancestry O

Introduction O
Ten O
to O
fifteen O
percent O
of O

also O
have O
close O
relatives O

and O
in O
many O
multiple-case O
families O
susceptibility O
to O
the O
disease O
appears O
to O
manifest O
as O
a O
dominantly O
inherited O
Mendelian O
trait O
. O

The O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
on O
chromosome O
17 O
co-segregates O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
is O
characteristic O
of O
families O
in O
which O
both O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
occur O
. O

A O
similar O
proportion O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
, O
especially O
those O
that O
include O
one O
or O
more O
cases O

is O

In O
the O
ten O
years O
since O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
were O
cloned O
and O
sequenced O
, O
thousands O
of O
pathogenic O

have O
been O
identified O
. O

The O
original O
expectation O
was O
that O
carriers O
of O
these O
mutations O
would O
have O
very O
high O
( O
> O
80 O
% O
) O
lifetime O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease

. O

Such O
dramatic O
effects O
seem O
to O
be O
confined O
to O
families O
with O
six O

more O
cases O
of O

with O
a O

Population-based O
studies O
show O
that O
the O
average O
risk O
to O
carriers O
( O
40 O
% O
to O
65 O
% O
) O
may O
be O
somewhat O
less O
than O
in O
multiple-case O

and O
may O

more O
than O
3 O

of O
all O
breast B-disease

. O

However O
, O
mutation O
carriers O
from O
multiple-case O

constitute O
cohorts O
in O
which O
hypotheses O
about O
the O
role O
of O
potential O
modifying O
genes O
and O
non-genetic O
risk O
factors O
can O
be O
tested O
. O

Such O
analyses O
need O
to O
be O
complemented O
by O
population-based O
studies O
so O
that O
estimates O
of O
the O
prevalence O
, O

can O
be O

for O

have O
not O
been O
selected O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

Mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene

are O
present O
in O
only O
35 O
% O

40 O
% O
of O
concentrated O

hence O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
other O
'high-penetrance O
' O

remain O
to O
be O
identified O
. O

Multiple-case O
families O
also O
have O
the O
potential O
, O
given O
sufficient O
numbers O
, O
to O
identify O
genes O
, O
such O
as O
CHEK2 B-gene
, O
that O
confer O
lower O
levels O
of O
risk O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
and O
that O
are O
more O
prevalent O
in O
the O
population O
. O

For O
these O
and O
other O
reasons O
, O
a O
series O
of O
discussions O
within O
the O
Australian O
cancer O
genetics O
and O
genetic O
epidemiology O
community O
in O
1995 O
led O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
national O
consortium O
. O

Its O
underlying O
goal O
was O
to O
foster O
research O
into O
the O
causes O
and O
impact O
of O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
would O
be O
achieved O
through O
construction O
of O
a O
research O
resource O
of O
genetic O
, O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
data O
, O
with O
appropriate O
biospecimens O
, O
to O
be O
available O
to O
researchers O
from O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

From O
its O
inception O
the O
consortium O
developed O
important O
links O
with O
the O
network O
of O
family O
cancer O
clinics O
( O

) O
around O
Australia O
, O
facilitating O

We O
report O

on O
the O

Since O
1997 O
, O
kConFab O
has O
been O
recruiting O
multiple O
individuals O
( O
affected O
and O
unaffected O
by O
cancer O
) O
from O
families O
that O
have O
presented O
to O
FCCs O
with O
evidence O
of O
high O

risk O
of O
breast B-disease

. O

The O
eligibility O
criteria O
for O
recruitment O
of O
families O
into O
kConFab O
have O
evolved O
over O
time O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
maximize O
the O
number O
of O
living O
potentially O
high-risk O
individuals O
, O
including O
carriers O
of O
high-penetrance O
alleles O
, O
whether O
affected O
by O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
not O
. O

Families O
are O
recruited O
by O
research O
nurses O
located O
in O
all O
the O
largest O
FCCs O
in O
Australia O
and O
New O

into O
five O
categories O
described O
in O
Table O
1 O
. O

The O
families O
are O
identified O
and O
initially O
evaluated O
as O
part O
of O
clinical O
care O
in O
an O
FCC O
. O

The O
de-identified O
pedigree O
is O
submitted O
to O
kConFab O
for O
review O
and O
, O
if O
judged O
eligible O
, O
the O
research O
nurse O
approaches O
a O
clinic-nominated O
Family O
Contact O
Person B-species

Additional O
family O

are O
invited O
to O
participate O
only O
with O
the O
permission O
of O
this O
person B-species
, O
or O
another O
relative O
subsequently O
recruited O
to O
kConFab O
. O

Participants B-species
can O
be O
identified O
from O
other O
sources O
, O
for O
example O
, O
by O
surgeons O
treating O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
from O
families O
who O
appear O
to O
fit O
the O
'potentially O
high O

' O
category O
, O
although O
recruitment O
is O
again O
via O
the O
kConFab O

. O

After O

, O
including O
verification O
of O
the O
family O
history O
of O
cancer O
, O
the O

is O
again O
reviewed O
and O
the O
final O
category O
recorded O
. O

The O
apparent O
strength O
of O
family O
history O
may O
have O
altered O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
verification O
of O
details O
, O
and O
so O
a O
proportion O
of O
families O
collected O
do O
not O
fit O
any O
category O
on O
completion O
( O
category O
0 O
) O
, O
most O
often O
because O
insufficient O
eligible O
individuals O
are O
alive O
. O

These O
families O
are O
not O
discarded O
as O
later O
follow-up O
may O
provide O
further O
information O
that O
may O
change O
their O
category O
. O

Breast B-disease
, I-disease
ovarian I-disease
and I-disease
other I-disease
cancers I-disease
are O
regarded O
as O
'sporadic O
' O
if O
they O
affect O
individuals O
in O
mutation-negative O
families O
who O
are O
unrelated O
by O
descent O
to O
other O
cases O
. O

Most O
'sporadic O
' O
cancers O
occur O
in O
spouses O
who O
do O
not O
themselves O
appear O
to O
have O
a O
maternal O
or O

is O
approached O
by O
the O
research O

via O
the O
Family O
Contact O
Person B-species
or O
another O
family O
member O
and O
their O
informed O
consent O
is O
obtained O
for O
participation O
in O
kConFab O
. O

The O
research O

invites O
participation O
by O
all O
family O
members O
reported O
to O

between O
affected O
individuals O
and O
both O
parents O
of O
any O
of O
these O
eligible O
individuals O
. O

Each O

, O
the O
research O

began O
annual O
follow-up O
of O
families O
via O
the O
Family O
Contact O

The O
main O
aim O
is O
to O
offer O
participation O
to O
individuals O
who O
have O
become O

for O
kConFab O
since O
the O

of O
participants B-species
who O
have O
recently O
become O
affected O
with O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
nurses O
also O
approach O
first-degree O
relatives O
of O
men B-species
and O
women B-species
who O
have O
learned O
( O

Ascertainment O
to O
kConFab O
is O
not O
population O

, O
but O
is O
dependent O
on O
clinical O
identification O
of O
individuals O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Data O
and O
analyses O
derived O
from O
cohorts O
of O
this O
type O
are O
shaped O
by O
the O
selection O
criteria O
used O
to O
refer O

, O
the O
specific O
kConFab O
ascertainment O
criteria O
, O
and O
by O
the O

. O

Such O
clinic-based O
studies O
can O
not O
replace O
population-based O
approaches O
but O
are O
complementary O
to O
them O
, O
and O
this O
project O
has O
already O
provided O
several O
examples O
of O
productive O
collaboration O
. O

However O
, O
we O
are O
only O
recruiting O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
high-risk O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
in O
Australia O
and O
New O

, O
and O
recruitment O
is O
not O
yet O
reaching O
a O
plateau O
. O

The O
number O
( O
1,159 O
) O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
for O
whom O
data O
is O
currently O
held O
is O
approximately O
5 O
% O
of O
the O
number O
predicted O
from O
the O
plausible O
population O
frequency O
of O
these O
alleles O
and O
the O
current O
population O
size O
of O
22 O
million O
. O

By O
the O
time O
recruitment O
of O
the O
kConFab O
cohort O
is O
complete O
, O
we O
estimate O
that O
we O
will O
have O
enrolled O
approximately O
10 O
% O
of O
multiple O
case O
families O
from O
Australia O
and O
New O

. O

Further O
analyses O
will O
be O
needed O
to O
test O
how O
representative O
the O
cohort O
is O
of O
the O
diverse O
populations O
of O
our O
two O
countries O
. O

The O
establishment O
of O
an O
organization O
such O
as O
kConFab O
can O
not O
be O
achieved O
without O
some O
difficulties O
. O

For O
example O
, O
large O
scale O
centralized O
pathology O
review O
of O
breast O
and O
other O
cancers O
occurring O
in O
kConFab O
participants B-species
is O
beyond O
the O
scope O
of O
current O
core O
activities O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
systematic O
review O
has O
focused O
on O
index O
cases O
of O
non-BRCA1/2 O
families O
since O
these O
data O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
of O
value O
to O
research O
projects O
. O

Additional O
pathology O
data O
are O
contributed O
to O
kConFab O
by O
investigators O
who O
undertake O
review O
in O
the O
context O
of O
specific O
research O
projects O
. O

Follow-up O
contact O
with O
the O
families O
has O
also O
proved O
challenging O
. O

For O
example O
, O
recontacting O
subjects O
for O
projects O
that O
include O
the O
study O
of O
known O
mutation O
carriers O
requires O
very O
careful O
attention O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
a O
family O
mutation O
is O
not O
revealed O
to O
individuals O
who O
do O
not O
know O
, O
or O
want O
to O
know O
, O
their O
mutation O
status O
. O

Projects O
that O
involve O
approaching O
both O
mutation-positive O
and O
mutation-negative O
members O
of O
families O
, O
and O
can O
be O
done O
blind O
to O
the O
mutation O
status O
, O
are O
easiest O
to O
accommodate O
within O
kConFab O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
issues O
has O
been O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
participants B-species
understand O
the O
differences O
between O
'research O
' O
and O
'clinical O
' O
mutation O
testing O
. O

Anecdotal O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
many O
participants B-species
still O
confuse O
the O
issues O
, O
and O
expect O
kConFab O
to O
give O
them O
individual O
mutation O
results O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
people B-species
enrolled O
in O
kConFab O
are O
not O
clients O
of O
FCCs O
, O
but O
relatives O
of O
people B-species
who O
are O
. O

Consequently O
, O
kConFab O
's O
notification O
letters O
do O
not O
tell O
individuals O
about O
their O
own O
carrier O
status O
, O
but O
state O
that O
a O
family O
specific O
mutation O
has O
been O
discovered O
and O
that O
if O
the O
individual O
wishes O
to O
know O
his/her O
carrier O
status O
, O
he/she O
should O
contact O
an O
FCC O
. O

A O
second O
blood O
sample O
can O
then O
be O
taken O
and O
tested O
in O
an O
accredited O
laboratory O
for O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
the O
family O
specific O
mutation O
. O

The O
result O
of O
this O
test O
is O
then O
given O
to O
the O
individual O
, O
after O
counseling O
. O

Even O
though O
kConFab O
's O
ascertainment O
strategy O
is O
targeted O
to O
individuals O
with O
a O
potentially O
high O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
their O
relatives O
, O
the O
family O
pedigrees O
contain O
many O
family O

who O
are O
not O
necessarily O
at O
high O
risk O
, O
for O

, O

, O
which O

the O
NCI-funded O
Breast O
Cancer O
Family O
Registry O
( O

that O
includes O
both O
clinic-based O
and O
population-based O
sites O
. O

There O
are O
enough O
similarities O
between O
these O
cohorts O
to O
allow O
collaborative O
projects O
to O
use O
data O
from O
each O
cohort O
. O

A O
major O
strength O
of O
kConFab O
over O
the O
BCFR O
is O
the O
large O
number O
of O
available O
blood O
samples O
per O
family O
, O
which O
allows O
for O
more O
accurate O
penetrance O
estimates O
, O
and O
a O
larger O
number O
of O
available O
samples O
from O
known O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

The O
BCLC O
families O
are O
large O
, O
but O
epidemiological O
data O
have O
not O
been O
systematically O
collected O
, O
nor O
is O
there O
a O
central O
repository O

biological O

for O
which O
researchers O
can O
apply O
. O

The O
Tyrer-Cuzick O
algorithm O
was O
applied O
to O
the O

to O
test O
its O
ability O

BRCA1 B-gene

In O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
positive O
families O
, O
the O

quintile O
included O
almost O
all O
the O

that O
developed O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
over O
the O
comparatively O
short O
period O
of O
four O
years O
of O
follow-up O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
in O
these O
families O
there O
was O
already O
considerable O
information O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
mutations O
throughout O
the O
families O
, O
and O
that O
this O
clearly O
contributed O
to O
the O
high O
predictive O
power O
of O
the O
risk O
estimates O
. O

When O
there O
was O
no O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
known O
in O
the O
family O
, O
the O
algorithm O
stratified O
the O
women B-species
much O
less O
strongly O
. O

This O
could O
be O
interpreted O
to O
mean O
that O
in O
these O
mutation O
negative O
families O
individual O
non-genetic O
risk O
factors O
such O
as O
parity O
and O
menarche O
still O
contribute O
to O
risk O
in O
the O
context O
of O
a O
strong O
family O
history O
but O
rather O
more O
weakly O
, O
even O
in O

, O
than O
as O

major O

. O

The O
future O

goals O
of O
kConFab O

Discussion O
To O
our O

this O

the O
largest O

the O
hypothesis O
that O
TP53 B-gene
Arg72Pro B-mutation

309T B-mutation

G I-mutation
influence O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
individually O
or O
in O
combination O
. O

Our O
findings O
of O
no O
association O
for O
these O
SNPs O
suggest O
that O
they O
have O
little O
or O
no O
effect O
on O
BRCA-related O
breast B-disease

Introduction O
The O
discovery O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene

has O
transformed O
the O

of O
women B-species
who O
are O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Diagnostically O
, O
it O
has O
facilitated O
the O
accurate O
identification O
of O
women B-species
at O
risk O
of O
cancer O
; O
through O
screening O
and O
preventive O
measures O
, O
it O
has O
reduced O
the O
incidence O
of O
cancer O
in O
such O
women B-species
, O
and O
perhaps O
most O
importantly O
, O
exploitation O
of O
the O
knowledge O
that O
these O
genes O
function O
in O
DNA O
repair O
has O
opened O
up O
avenues O
for O
the O
development O
of O
new O
treatments O
for O
women B-species
with O
hereditary O
tumours O
. O

Although O
predictive O
genetic O
testing O
is O
increasingly O
becoming O
a O
part O
of O
clinical O
practice O
in O
many O
developed O
countries O
, O
the O

and O
the O

knowledge O
about O
the O

of O
these O

in O

has O
limited O
its O

; O
and O
an O

Taken O

, O
studies O

be O

, O
it O

Currently O

Using O
a O

, O
reported O

One O

was O

in O
Singapore O
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
found O
in O

Malays B-species
in O
our O
study O
. O

We O
did O
not O
identify O
any O

that O
occur O
with O
high O

in O

Four O

were O
also O

in O
our O
cohort O
but O
these O
are O
unlikely O
to O
be O
common O
enough O
to O
warrant O
specific O
testing O
. O

Given O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
of O
the O
Asian O
populations O
, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
screening O
for O
a O
panel O
of O
founder O
mutations O
will O
be O
as O
effective O
in O
this O
population O
as O
is O
the O
case O
for O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
or O
Icelandic O
populations O
. O

We O
found O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
genetic O
susceptibility O
among O
the O
small O
numbers O
of O
Malays B-species
in O
this O
cohort O
. O

Similar O
associations O
have O
been O
reported O
among O
the O
Filipinos B-species
and O
Japanese B-species
. O

However O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
a O
higher O
proportion O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
over O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
is O
not O
known O
, O
but O
may O
reflect O
cohort O
selection O
, O
genetic O
drift O
, O
or O
a O
possible O
prevalence O
of O
a O
modifying O
genetic O
or O
environmental O
factor O
that O
modifies O
the O
penetrance O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
among O
Malays B-species
. O

Further O
studies O
using O
larger O
cohorts O
of O
Malay O
individuals O
are O
needed O
to O
address O
these O
possibilities O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
clearly O
deleterious O
protein-truncating O
mutations O
, O
a O
number O
of O
unclassified O
sequence O
variants O
were O
detected O
by O
sequencing O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
nine O
of O
16 O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
56 O
% O
) O
and O
17 O
of O
31 O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
novel O
( O
55 O
% O
) O
, O
and O
several O
of O
the O
remainder O
have O
only O
been O
described O
in O
Asian O
women B-species
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
these O
sequence O
variants O
have O
no O
clinical O
relevance O
, O
and O
the O
few O
that O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
deleterious O
are O
unlikely O
to O
change O
the O
basic O
conclusions O
of O
this O
study O
. O

We O
are O
conducting O
further O
analyses O
using O
established O
methods O
to O
better O
understand O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
these O

in O
our O

Predicting O

family O
status O
in O
Asia O
As O
BRCA1 B-gene

is O
expensive O
, O
any O
ability O
to O
determine O
the O
probability O
that O
a O
specific O
family O
may O
benefit O
is O
an O
important O
issue O
. O

Several O
tools O
have O
been O
developed O
to O
help O
clinicians O
in O
predicting O
the O
probability O
of O
carrying O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
based O
on O
the O
familial O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
all O
tools O
have O
been O
based O
on O
populations O
where O
the O
age-standardised O
rate O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
has O
been O
significantly O
higher O
than O
that O
reported O
in O
Malaysia O
( O
80 O

100,000 O
compared O
with O
30 O

) O
. O

The O
Manchester O
Scoring O
System O
is O
perhaps O
the O
easiest O
of O
these O
prediction O
tools O
to O
use O
, O
and O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
likelihood O
of O
identifying O
a O
mutation O
in O
a O
family O
reaches O
the O
10 O
% O
threshold O
for O
either O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

This O
model O
is O
does O
not O
require O
computer O
implementation O

However O
, O

the O
Manchester O

devised O
using O

from O
the O
Manchester O

, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
as O
effective O
in O
populations O
with O
different O

Our O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
a O

a O

seems O
optimal O
as O
a O

Notably O
, O
for O
the O

the O

the O

The O
optimal O

appears O
to O
be O
lower O
for O
our O
population O
compared O
with O
studies O
in O
Australians B-species

were O

Taken O
together O
, O
our O
data O
suggests O
that O
in O
populations O
such O
as O
ours O
, O
where O
the O
overall O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
is O
lower O
than O
that O
in O
Caucasian O
populations O
, O
family O
history O
is O
more O
significant O
therefore O
giving O
a O
higher O
specificity O
at O
a O
lower O
score O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
BOADICEA O
requires O
computation O
and O
is O
more O
difficult O
to O
implement O
in O
a O
clinical O
setting O
that O
is O
not O
familiar O
with O
risk O
prediction O
and O
genetic O
testing O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
model O
relies O
in O
its O
ability O
to O
compute O
extensive O
family O
history O
, O
and O
mutations O
in O
other O
genes O
relevant O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
such O
as O
CHEK2 B-gene
, O
to O
calculate O
the O
probability O
of O
carrying O
a O
mutation O
in O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
. O

In O
our O
analysis O
, O
a O
cut-off O
probability O
of O
10 O
% O
or O
higher O
yielded O
comparable O
specificity O
albeit O
with O
compromised O
sensitivity O
( O
85 O
% O
and O
40 O
% O
respectively O
) O
to O
that O
reported O
in O
an O
analysis O
of O
300 O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
, O
predominantly O
Caucasian O
families O
( O

68 O
% O
and O

% O
respectively O
) O
. O

We O
found O
that O
both O
the O
Manchester O
Scoring O
System O
and O
BOADICEA O
underestimated O
the O
number O
of O
mutation O
carriers O
in O
our O
cohort O
. O

The O
most O
likely O
explanation O
, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
other O
studies O
, O
may O
be O
that O
both O
methods O
underestimate O
the O
number O
of O
carriers O
in O
families O
with O
insignificant O
family O
history O
, O
that O
is O
both O
methods O
underestimate O
the O
exceptional O
nature O
of O
the O
families O
, O
within O
the O
context O
of O
a O
lower O
population O
rate O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
underestimate O
may O
be O
more O
significant O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
BOADICEA O
because O
the O
allelic O
frequency O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
may O
be O
different O
in O
the O
ethnic O
population O
we O
have O
studied O
compared O
with O
Caucasian O
populations O
, O
and O
may O
be O
because O
BRCA2 B-gene
may O
have O
a O
different O
penetrance O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Overall O
, O
in O
this O
typically O
Asian O
cohort O
where O
80 O
% O
( O
149 O
of O
187 O
) O
of O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
had O
no O
or O
only O
a O
single O
first- O
or O
second-degree O
relative O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
15 O
% O
of O
women B-species
carried O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
a O
family O
history O
as O
reported O
by O
an O
individual O
who O
carries O
a O
mutation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
may O
be O
neither O
dramatic O
nor O
obvious O
. O

Indeed O
, O
in O
a O
study O
of O
10,000 O
individuals O
in O
the O
USA O
, O
up O
to O
13 O
% O
of O
individuals O
with O
a O
single O
first- O
or O
second-degree O
relative O
with O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
carried O
deleterious O
mutations O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
careful O
evaluation O
of O
paternal O
as O
well O
as O
maternal O
family O
history O
is O
required O
, O
especially O
in O
women B-species
diagnosed O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
before O
age O
50 O
years O
or O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
any O
age O
, O
to O
enable O
the O
appropriate O
identification O
and O
counselling O
of O
individuals O
at O
risk O
of O
carrying O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

We O
believe O
that O
identification O
of O
individuals O
at O
risk O
is O
particularly O
significant O
in O
Asia O
because O
the O
problem O
of O
limited O
family O
structure O
is O
not O
uncommon O
, O
in O
part O
because O
of O
loss O
of O
family O
information O
from O
migration O
, O
and O
there O
remains O
significant O
stigma O
in O
talking O
about O
cancer O
. O

Conclusion O
Taking O
into O
consideration O
the O
recommendations O
described O
above O
and O
our O
findings O
, O
it O
seems O
reasonable O
in O
a O
clinical O
setting O
to O
offer O
individuals O
with O
a O
personal O
or O
family O
history O
of O
cancer O
testing O
if O
they O
have O
a O
combined O
Manchester O
score O
of O
15 O
or O
above O
. O

Lower O
thresholds O
could O
be O
used O
when O

available O
and O
where O
the O
judgement O
of O
health O
care O

in O

indicates O
. O

Our O
study O
underscores O
the O
need O
for O
larger O

to O
validate O
the O

However O
, O
given O

Interestingly O
, O
although O

the O

does O
not O
show O
significant O

suggesting O
that O
in O
the O

a O
greater O
proportion O
of O

is O
due O
to O

According O
to O
the O
National O
Cancer O
Registry O
Project O
[ O

] O
based O
on O
cancer O
registries O
at O
six O
hospitals O
, O
the O
average O

was O
found O
to O
range O
from O

( O
Dibrugarh O

to O
49.6 O

( O

. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
average O
age O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
in O
various O
population-based O
registries O
throughout O
India O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
50-53 O
years O
whereas O
amongst O
US O
white O

it O
is O
61.0 O
years O
showing O
that O
in O
Indian O

, O
disease O
occurs O
a O
decade O
earlier O
than O
in O
Western O
populations O
. O

Several O
environmental O
risk O
factors O
that O
may O
contribute O
to O
or O
hasten O
the O
development O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
have O
been O
identified O
, O
including O
mainly O
lifestyle O
and O
reproductive O
factors O
. O

These O
may O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
observed O
trends O
and O
the O
variation O
in O
incidence O
rates O
between O
developed O
and O
developing O
countries O
. O

The O
factor O
with O
the O
strongest O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
association O
is O
a O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
associated O
risk O
being O
even O
higher O
for O
family O
history O
of O
early O
onset O
disease O
( O
< O

age O
40 O
) O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
present O
at O
an O
early O
age O
relative O
to O
sporadic O
cancer O
, O
and O
genetic O
factors O
are O
considered O
to O
play O
major O
role O
in O
their O
development O
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
earlier O
average O
age O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
Indian O
women B-species
is O
intriguing O
, O
suggestive O
of O
a O
significant O
genetic O
component O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Genetic O
susceptibility O
to O
cancer O
is O
triggered O
in O
several O
ways O
, O
the O
best O
understood O
causal O
mechanism O
being O
due O
to O
inactivating O
germline O
mutations O
in O
tumor O

and O
DNA O
repair O
genes O
, O
which O
lead O
to O
an O
accumulation O
of O
mutations O
in O
oncogenes O
and O
cell-cycle O
checkpoints O
that O
are O
required O
for O

About O
5-10 O

, O
185delAG B-mutation
has O
been O
reported O
in O
all O
populations O
studied O
( O
Table O

) O
. O

This O
deleterious O
frame O

mutation O
was O
first O
reported O
in O
a O
family O
residing O
in O
a O
part O
of O
Trivandrum O
not O
far O
from O
the O
small O
towns O
with O
settlement O
of O
Jewish O
people B-species
. O

It O
was O
later O
reported O
in O
two O
South O
Indian O
families O
from O
Kerala O
province O
as O
well O
as O
in O
two O

from O

, O
where O
a O

, O
with O

significant O
influence O
of O
Portuguese O
( O
potential O
introduction O
of O

through O
Sephardic B-species
Jews I-species
) O
. O

Surprisingly O
, O
we O
have O
found O
185delAG B-mutation
in O
a O
North O
Indian O
Hindu O
patient B-species
residing O
in O
New O
Delhi O
who O
claimed O
to O
have O
no O
Jewish O
ancestry O
. O

Similarly O
, O
Lakhotia O
et O
al. O
, O
in O
their O
initial O
screening O
found O
the O
same O
mutation O
in O
four O
Indian O

families O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
clearly O
established O
founder O

for O
185delAG B-mutation
, O
this O
mutation O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
arisen O
independently O
at O

twice O
, O
thus O
it O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
evaluate O

of O
these O

The O

It O
is O

that O

identified O
in O
15 O
additional O

These O

be O
further O
evaluated O
in O

them O
into O
high- O
or O

categories O

performed O
by O

It O

that O
the O

method O
utilized O
is O
approximately O
80 O

Although O
the O

is O
lower O
than O
some O
other O

analysis O
techniques O
( O
e.g O

, O
it O

been O

To O
increase O
the O
efficacy O

, O
the O
screening O
for O
mutations O
in O
both O
the O

was O
repeated O
by O

in O
all O

Moreover O
no O
currently O

guarantee O
100 O
% O
detection O
of O
pathogenic O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

In O
particular O
, O
all O
PCR O

methods O
are O
unable O
to O
detect O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
that O
occur O
frequently O
in O
both O
genes O
and O
can O
account O
for O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutations O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
number O
of O
clearly O
disease-associated O
mutations O
identified O
in O
the O
studied O
North-Indian O
population O
is O
lower O
than O
observed O
elsewhere O
. O

However O
, O
a O

proportion O
of O
women B-species
who O
had O
breast B-disease

diagnosed O
at O
age O
< O

without O

. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O

account O
for O
a O
comparatively O
small O

of O

. O

This O
suggests O
one O
of O
several O
possibilities O
with O
respect O
to O
genetic O
predisposition O
in O
the O
North O
Indian O
population O
. O

First O
, O
there O
may O
be O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
that O
are O
large O
germ O
line O
rearrangements O
, O
which O
would O
not O
have O
been O
detected O
by O
the O
method O
of O
mutation O
screening O
employed O
. O

Second O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
there O
are O
some O
unknown O
genes O
, O
which O
may O
contribute O
more O
significantly O
to O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in O
this O
population O
than O
do O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
present O
study O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
findings O
from O
our O
pilot O
study O
done O
on O
a O
small O
independent O
group O
of O
20 O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
where O
3 O
out O
of O
5 O
cases O
with O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
had O
early O
onset O
disease O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
postulate O
that O
women B-species
with O
early-onset O
disease O
without O
family O
history O
are O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
disease O
associated O
alteration O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
. O

A O
similar O
viewpoint O
has O
been O
put O
forwarded O
by O
a O
study O
conducted O
on O
Iranian O
women B-species
where O
it O
concluded O
that O
early O
onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
with O
a O
limited O
family O
history O
or O
without O
family O
history O
is O
sufficient O
to O
justify O
mutation O
screening O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
significant O
number O
of O
early O
onset O
patients B-species
without O
reported O
family O
history O
have O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
germ O
line O
mutations O
that O
are O
paternally O
inherited O
. O

In O
many O
cultures O
, O
knowledge O
of O
family O
history O
of O
disease O
is O
better O
documented O
along O
matrilineal O
lines O
, O
particularly O
those O
diseases O
that O
are O
gender O
restricted O
. O

A O
possible O
explanation O
for O
the O
earlier O
age O
of O
disease O
onset O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
could O
be O
high O
circulatory O
estrogen O
levels O
in O
younger O
women B-species
compared O
to O
elderly O
women B-species
. O

According O
to O
one O
hypothesis O
, O
the O
total O
number O
of O
ovulatory O
cycles O
and O
thus O
exposure O
to O
higher O
estrogen O
level O
is O
a O
significant O
factor O
contributing O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Estrogen O
exposure O
is O
hypothesized O
to O
increase O
the O
susceptibility O
to O
breast O
tissue O
to O
carcinogenesis O
through O
continued O
cell O
division O
and O
proliferation O
resulting O
from O
multiple O
ovulatory O
cycles O
, O
principally O
between O
menarche O
and O
first O
birth O
, O
thus O
allowing O
for O
a O
concomitant O
increase O
in O
the O
accumulation O
of O
random O
genetic O
errors O
. O

Increased O
estrogenic O
exposures O
increase O
the O
rate O
of O
proliferation O
, O
hence O
magnifying O
the O
effect O
. O

Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
wild-type O
BRCA1 B-gene
blocks O
estrogen O
receptor O
( O
ER O
) O
mediated O
transcriptional O
activation O
, O
thereby O
inhibiting O
estrogenic O
signalling O
. O

These O
observations O
could O
account O
for O
the O
higher O
proportion O
of O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
populations O
where O
exposures O
to O
risk O
factors O
that O
primarily O
influence O
post-menopausal O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risks O
are O
, O
as O
yet O
, O
relatively O
low O
. O

Extensive O
mutation O
screening O
of O
high-risk O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
primarily O
targeting O
early-onset O
cases O
should O
be O
undertaken O
in O
India O
with O
proper O
genetic O
counseling O
, O
since O
female O
carriers O
of O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
are O
also O
at O
a O
high O
risk O
for O
developing O
a O
second O
malignancy O
either O
in O
the O
breast O
or O
ovary O
. O

Personal O
risk O
information O
may O
help O
in O
taking O
preventive O
measures O
and O
also O
motivate O
a O
high-risk O
woman B-species
to O
adopt O
breast O
screening O
that O
may O
promote O
early O
detection O
and O
improve O
chances O
of O
surviving O

In O
some O

This O

allow O
for O
the O

of O

not O
only O
in O
people B-species
of O

Jewish O

also O

as O

Background O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
two O
most O
frequently O
mutated O
genes O
underlying O
inherited B-disease
breast I-disease

As O
both O
are O
large O
multi-exon O
genes O
, O
with O
inactivating O
mutations O
occurring O
across O
the O
entire O
coding O
region O
, O
the O
consequent O
cost O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
screening O
has O
limited O

to O
those O
who O
are O
most O
likely O

have O
a O

based O

Consequently O
, O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O

The O

it O

be O
some O

In O

, O
an O

to O
highlight O

Discussion O
DNA O
sequencing O
is O
regarded O
as O
the O
gold O
standard O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
detection O
. O

However O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
most O
testing O
laboratories O
perform O
a O
preliminary O
scan O
of O
exons O
and O
splice O
junctions O
using O
methods O
such O
as O
the O
protein O
truncation O
test O
( O
PTT O
) O
, O
denaturing O
gradient O
gel O
electrophoresis O
( O
DGGE O
) O
and/or O
denaturing O
high O
pressure O
liquid O
chromatography O
( O
DHPLC O
) O
to O
reduce O
cost O
and O
increase O
throughput O
. O

Any O
region O
that O
is O
found O
to O
potentially O
contain O
a O
mutation O
by O
scanning O
is O
then O
characterised O
by O
sequencing O
. O

Scanning O
methods O
are O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
studies O
involving O
large O
numbers O
of O
individuals O
. O

A O
recent O
Canadian O
study O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
PTT O
, O
DGGE O
and O
DHPLC O
to O
scan O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
, O
followed O
by O
DNA O
sequencing O
to O
screen O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Although O
very O
sensitive O
, O
PTT O
, O
DGGE O
and O
DHPLC O
do O
not O
detect O
all O
mutations O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
PTT O
, O
which O
is O
used O
for O
screening O
of O
the O
large O
exons O
comprising O
approximately O
half O
of O
the O
total O
sequence O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
, O
does O
not O
detect O
missense O
alterations O
. O

Both O
DHPLC O
and O
DGGE O
are O
both O
operator O
and O
interpreter O
sensitive O
. O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
DHPLC O
, O
which O
is O
currently O
considered O
as O
the O
gold O
standard O
of O
screening O
methods O
, O
is O
superior O
to O
DGGE O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

HRM O
is O
an O
in-well O
scanning O
method O
in O
which O
the O
melting O
analysis O
is O
performed O
immediately O
after O
the O
PCR O
amplification O
and O
is O
thus O
particularly O
suitable O
for O
high-throughput O
applications O
. O

HRM O
is O
predicted O
to O
have O
close O
to O
a O
100 O
% O
sensitivity O
as O
each O
heterozygous O
mutation O
should O
create O
a O
readily O
detected O
heteroduplex O
. O

Heterozygotes O
are O
readily O
recognisable O
by O
HRM O
because O
they O
form O
a O
proportion O
of O
heteroduplexes O
which O
melt O
differently O
to O
perfectly O
matched O
homoduplexes O
. O

The O
use O
of O
HRM O
to O
detect O
both O
known O
and O
novel O
germline O
mutations O
has O
been O
reported O
for O
several O
other O
genes O
including O
the O
EXT1 B-gene
, O
EXT2 B-gene
, O
RET B-gene
, O
GJB1 B-gene
and O
CFTR B-gene
genes O
. O

All O
germline O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
are O
expected O
to O
occur O
in O
heterozygotes O
as O
mutant O
homozygotes O
are O
lethal O
and O
consistent O
with O
this O
, O
none O
have O
been O
reported O
. O

A O
comparative O
study O
has O
recently O
shown O
that O
the O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
of O
HRM O
is O
better O
than O
DHPLC O
which O
is O
the O
current O
gold O
standard O
of O
scanning O
methods O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
HRM O
is O
more O
rapid O
as O
the O
melting O
analysis O
is O
performed O
in O
all O
wells O
simultaneously O
whereas O
DHPLC O
involves O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
PCR O
product O
( O
in O
itself O
problematical O
because O
of O
the O
PCR O
contamination O
issue O
) O
and O
then O
the O
sequential O
analysis O
of O
each O
sample O
. O

The O
instrumentation O
for O
DHPLC O
is O
more O
expensive O
and O
the O
analysis O
generates O
chemical O
waste O
which O
requires O
disposal O
. O

There O
are O
therefore O
significant O
time O
and O
cost O
advantages O
in O
adopting O
HRM O
. O

In O
our O
hands O
, O
all O
the O
different O
mutations O
in O
the O
3 O
regions O
that O
we O
analysed O
from O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
were O
detected O
, O
giving O
us O
a O
sensitivity O
of O
100 O
% O
in O
this O
pilot O
study O
. O

The O
true O
sensitivity O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
in O
a O
larger O
study O
, O
but O
publications O
for O
other O
genes O
indicate O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
very O
high O
. O

A O
larger O
study O
is O
currently O
underway O
in O
our O
lab O
testing O
several O
hundred O
known O
mutations O
in O
historic O
samples O
across O
all O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
coding O
regions O
in O
combination O
with O
the O
screening O
of O
prospectively O
collected O
diagnostic O
samples O
. O

This O
will O
provide O
further O
insight O
into O
the O
true O
sensitivity O
of O
HRM O
and O
applicability O
of O
the O
method O
for O
mutation O
scanning O
of O
the O
entire O
coding O
regions O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
three O
founder O
mutations O
associated O
with O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
ancestry O
are O
generally O
identified O
using O
sequencing O
and O
, O
once O
a O
mutation O
is O
identified O
in O
a O
family O
, O
other O
family O
members O
can O
undergo O
predictive O
testing O
by O
sequencing O
for O
the O
exon O
in O
which O
the O
mutation O
was O
identified O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
three O
founder O
mutations O
is O
relatively O
high O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
second O
mutation O
might O
be O
segregating O
in O
the O
family O
and O
so O
ideally O
all O
founder O
mutations O
should O
be O
sought O
in O
other O
family O
members O
. O

HRM O
would O
allow O
testing O
for O
all O
three O
Ashkenazi O
mutations O
in O
family O
members O
at O
relatively O
low O
cost O
. O

The O
testing O
would O
also O
enable O
inexpensive O
population-based O
screening O
of O
individuals O
with O
Jewish O
ancestry O
for O
the O
founder O
mutations O
. O

We O
also O
detected O
the O
5331G B-mutation
> I-mutation
A I-mutation
mutation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
exon O
20 O
that O
has O
recently O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
Greek O
founder O
mutation O
. O

Large O
scale O
screening O
for O
this O
founder O
mutation O
can O
now O
be O
undertaken O
in O
relevant O
populations O
. O

A O
similar O
approach O
can O
be O
applied O
to O
other O
founder O
mutations O
in O
regions O
not O
screened O
for O
in O
this O
study O
. O

The O
ability O
to O
detect O
mutations O
by O
HRM O
alone O
has O
implications O
for O
economical O
large O
scale O
population O
screening O
studies O
to O
understand O
the O
prevalence O
and O
characteristics O
of O
other O
known O
or O
suspected O
founder O
mutations O
. O

HRM O
can O
also O
be O
used O
as O
an O
inexpensive O
methodology O
for O
tracking O
mutations O
across O
pedigrees O
. O

Each O
mutation O
had O
a O
characteristic O
melting O
profile O
that O
would O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
identified O
by O
using O
a O
control O
for O
that O
mutation O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
this O
would O
remove O
the O
necessity O
for O
sequencing O
. O

However O
, O
for O
diagnostic O
purposes O
, O
any O
apparently O
mutation O
positive O
individual O
should O
be O
confirmed O
by O
sequencing O
as O
different O
mutations O
can O
also O
have O
similar O
profiles O
. O

Dufresne O
and O
colleagues O
reported O
the O
use O
of O
melt O
curve O
analysis O
for O
the O
specific O
detection O
of O
the O
Ashkenazi O
mutations O
using O
SYBR O
Green O
1 O
incorporation O
as O
monitored O
by O
a O
standard O
real O
time O
PCR O
machine O
. O

This O
approach O
is O
melting O
analysis O
rather O
then O
the O
high O
resolution O
melting O
( O
HRM O
) O
we O
have O
used O
here O
. O

Whereas O
their O
methodology O
is O
capable O
of O
detecting O
known O
mutations O
such O
as O
the O
Ashkenazi O
mutations O
by O
designing O
primers O
flanking O
those O
mutations O
, O
our O
methodology O
is O
an O
essentially O
different O
and O
more O
powerful O
methodology O
which O
is O
designed O
primarily O
as O
a O
screening O
methodology O
. O

We O
used O
an O
appropriate O
dye O
for O
high O
resolution O
melting O
, O
an O
HRM O
enabled O
real O
time O
PCR O
machine O
( O
only O
recently O
available O
) O
and O
software O
that O
allows O
HRM O
analysis O
to O
be O
performed O
. O

The O
greater O
sensitivity O
of O
HRM O
allowed O
longer O
amplicons O
to O
be O
used O
( O
534 O
base O
pairs O
was O
successfully O
used O
for O
the O
region O
surrounding O
the O
6174delT B-mutation
mutation O
) O
which O
allows O
for O
the O
screening O
of O
unknown O
mutations O
as O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
. O

Thus O
by O
examining O
extra O
, O
non-founder O
mutations O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O
founder O
mutations O
we O
show O
that O
this O
method O
easily O
detects O
missense O
mutations O
as O
well O
as O
small O
insertions O
and O
deletions O
. O

Interestingly O

Based O
on O
our O
current O
findings O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
that O
HRM O
for O
mutation O

will O
prove O
superior O
to O
the O
current O
germline O

approaches O
in O
terms O
of O
speed O
, O
and O
cost O
and O
give O
at O
least O
equivalent O
sensitivity O
. O

HRM O
is O
the O
most O
rapid O
of O
the O
current O
screening O
methods O
as O
the O
only O
set-up O
involved O
is O
the O
PCR O
amplification O
, O
up O
to O
384 O
reactions O
can O
be O
tested O
in O
the O
one O
run O
for O
a O
given O
amplicon O
and O
the O
results O
can O
be O
rapidly O
scanned O
by O
a O
technician O
. O

Consequently O
, O
HRM O
is O
the O
least O
expensive O
of O
the O
current O
screening O
methods O
as O
the O
only O
consumables O
cost O
involved O
is O
the O
PCR O
amplification O
with O
a O
HRM O
dye O
and O
the O
reaction O
vessels O
while O
the O
rapid O
scanning O
reduces O
labour O
costs O
. O

Consequently O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
HRM O
may O
become O
the O
method O
of O
choice O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene

in O
both O
the O

Conclusion O
This O
study O
demonstrates O
the O
use O
of O
HRM O
as O
a O
method O
to O
scan O
for O
the O
common O
germline O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
such O
as O
those O
seen O
in O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
individuals O
. O

It O
also O
demonstrates O
the O
potential O
of O
this O
method O
for O
screening O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
as O
every O
mutation O
tested O
for O
was O
readily O
detected O
. O

Whereas O
, O
the O
use O
of O
HRM O
for O
full O
screening O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
still O
needs O
to O
be O
verified O
by O
sequencing O
, O
screening O
for O
the O
Ashkenazi O
founder O

( O

be O
carried O
out O
by O
laboratories O
with O
access O
to O
the O
increasingly O
available O
high O

platform O
. O

The O
method O
is O
sensitive O
, O
rapid O
and O
cost O
effective O
and O
will O
markedly O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O

both O

Interestingly O
, O

In O

In O
another O

were O

In O

that O

suppressed O

manner O

through O
preventing O

thus O
reducing O

As O
demonstrated O

wild-type O
BRCA1 O

able O
to O
induce O
a O
large O
reduction O

In O
addition O

its O
interaction O

the O
IGF1R O
, O
BRCA1 O
interacts O

With O
induction O

the O
authors O
observed O

Based O
on O
these O
experiments O
, O
there O
is O
strong O
evidence O
that O
mutant O
forms O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
cause O
increased O
IGF1R O
activation O
, O
leading O
to O
a O
decrease O

and O
a O
concomitant O
increased O
survival O
of O
malignant O
cells O
, O
which O
then O
can O
proliferate O
. O

There O
is O
therefore O
a O
strong O
rationale O
for O
why O
genetic O
variation O
in O
IGF1R B-gene
and O
IRS1 B-gene
would O
be O
important O
in O
breast B-disease

in O

. O

Experimental O
studies O
have O
not O

demonstrate O
whether O
there O
is O
a O

. O

As O
noted O
above O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O

the O
role O

in O
women B-species

in O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
. O

While O
the O
study O
does O
provide O
an O
important O
first O
step O
in O
identifying O
potential O
genetic O
modifiers O
of O
risk O
among O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
it O
does O
suffer O
some O
limitations O
. O

First O
, O
although O
the O
IGF O
pathway O
was O
hypothesized O
a O
priori O
as O
a O
source O
for O
potential O
modifiers O
, O
multiple O
LD O
blocks O
were O
considered O
for O
association O
testing O
and O
such O
testing O
could O
lead O
to O
inflation O
of O
the O
overall O
type O
I O
error O
rate O
for O
the O
study O
. O

With O
this O
said O
, O
we O
only O
studied O
a O
small O
number O
of O
the O
genes O
in O
IGF O

that O
we O
deemed O
a O

would O
potentially O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
time O
to O
diagnosis O
. O

Further O
, O
the O
goal O
of O
the O
current O
research O
was O
to O
generate O
hypotheses O
based O
upon O
the O
results O
from O
this O
well-defined O
set O
of O
genes O
, O
and O
it O
is O
our O
intention O
to O
further O
validate O
these O
results O
using O
an O
independent O
sample O
. O

As O
with O
all O
observational O
studies O
, O
there O
is O
the O
potential O
for O
selection O
bias O
and O
unmeasured O
confounding O
. O

We O
have O
, O
however O
, O
adjusted O
for O
those O
environmental O
factors O
that O
previous O
research O
has O
shown O
to O
most O
highly O
influence O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
within O
this O
cohort O
, O
thus O
lowering O
the O
potential O
for O
unadjusted O
confounding O
. O

We O
and O
others O
have O
investigated O
putative O
risk O
factors O
, O
and O
a O

of O

have O

Our O

also O

Conclusion O
In O

in O
keeping O

the O
estimates O
obtained O
originally O
from O

This O
is O

true O
for O

Background O
Since O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
debate O
has O
focussed O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
associated O
with O

in O
these O
genes O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
calculated O
cancer O

are O
dependent O
on O
the O
method O

Thus O

in O

Discussion O
We O
present O
data O
on O
a O
large O
cohort O
of O
women B-species
identified O
as O
carriers O
or O
presumed O
carriers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
UK O
population O
. O

The O
penetrance O
estimates O
derived O
from O
these O
women B-species
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
derived O
from O
the O
BCLC O
cohort O
of O
high-risk O
families O
with O
lifetime O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
of O
close O
to O
85 O
% O
for O
both O
genes O
. O

The O
estimate O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
was O
also O
very O
similar O
with O
risks O
to O
70 O
years O
of O
60 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
and O
33 O
% O
as O
opposed O
to O
27 O
% O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
higher O
overall O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
estimates O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
were O
related O
to O
competing O
mortality O
from O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Many O
risk O
factors O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
similar O
( O
early O
menarche O
, O
late O
menopause O
, O
nulliparity O
) O
and O
women B-species
with O
these O
may O
have O
died O
from O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
before O
they O
developed O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
effect O
would O
be O
more O
prominent O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
would O
potentially O
explain O
the O
higher O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
penetrance O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
ratio O
of O
those O
testing O
positive O
: O
negative O
for O
the O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
whilst O
still O
unaffected O
also O
gives O
support O
to O
high O
penetrance O
. O

Of O
those O
women B-species
without O
an O
affected O
daughter O
, O
< O
10 O
% O
of O
those O
aged O
over O
60 O
years O
, O
tested O
positive O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
< O
20 O
% O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
figures O
over O
60 O
years O
are O
, O
nonetheless O
based O
on O
small O
numbers O
. O

The O
earlier O
drop O
in O
positive O
: O
negative O
ratio O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
almost O
certainly O
represents O
a O
higher O
combined O
risk O
of O
both O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
to O
50 O
and O
60 O
years O
. O

Another O
supportive O
feature O
is O
shown O
in O
Table O
2 O
. O

The O
typical O
families O
tested O
in O
our O
centre O
have O
a O
Manchester O
score O
of O
20+ O
reflecting O
multiple O
early O
onset O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
family O
. O

The O
less O
`` O
high O
'' O
risk O
clusters O
as O
evidenced O
by O
lower O
Manchester O
scores O
had O
a O
higher O
proportion O
testing O
positive O
> O
50 O
years O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
Manchester O
score O
could O
be O
used O
as O
a O
bench-mark O
to O
predict O
penetrance O
particularly O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
families O
. O

Whilst O
all O
attempts O
to O
assess O
penetrance O
have O
their O
inherent O
biases O
and O
assumptions O
this O
can O
not O
be O
said O
of O
the O
results O
of O
presymptomatic O
testing O
. O

The O
only O
potential O
bias O
would O
be O
if O
women B-species
had O
an O
inkling O
that O
they O
would O
test O
positive O
or O
negative O
prior O
to O
coming O
forward O
. O

This O
is O
not O
borne O
out O
by O
our O
results O
particularly O
accounting O
for O
Manchester O
score O
. O

The O
previously O
reported O
positional O
effect O
of O
mutations O
for O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
is O
not O
borne O
out O
by O
our O
analysis O
. O

No O
substantial O
effect O
of O
increased O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
was O
seen O
in O
the O
respective O
ovarian O
cluster O
regions O
of O
each O
gene O
and O
only O
a O
borderline O
significant O
reduction O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
was O
seen O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

Much O
of O
the O
OCCR O
association O
has O
been O
based O
on O
ratios O
of O
breast B-disease
to I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
on O
the O
presence O
or O
not O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
family O
. O

Even O
this O
reliance O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
has O
been O
questioned O
by O
the O
report O
of O
58 O
% O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
related O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
having O
mutations O
outside O
the O
OCCR O
. O

Although O
the O
BCLC O
study O
on O
BRCA1 B-gene
positional O
effect O
included O
356 O
families O
compared O
to O
our O
223 O
families O
no O
absolute O
estimate O
of O
penetrance O
was O
made O
. O

Whilst O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
incidence O
was O
lower O
in O
the O
central O
portion O
of O
the O
gene O
( O
nucleotides O
2401-4190 O
) O
( O
RR O
0.71 O
) O
in O
their O
analysis O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
derive O
absolute O
risk O
figures O
for O
each O
portion O
of O
the O
gene O
. O

Additionally O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
our O
more O
extensive O
testing O
of O
unaffected O
relatives O
may O
provide O
a O
more O
accurate O
overall O
picture O
as O
reported O
here O
. O

Accurate O
estimates O
of O
cancer O
risk O
are O
essential O
for O
families O
and O
individuals O
undertaking O
genetic O
testing O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
any O
account O
should O
be O
taken O
of O
the O
OCCR O
in O
each O
gene O
or O
indeed O
any O
substantial O
positional O
effect O
in O
genetic O
counselling O
. O

It O
is O
also O
clear O
that O
for O
individuals O
undertaking O
predictive O
genetic O
testing O
in O
the O
context O
of O
families O
ascertained O
from O
cancer O
genetic O
clinics O
as O
opposed O
to O
population O
testing O
that O
risk O
figures O
similar O
to O
those O
derived O
in O
our O
study O
or O
the O
BCLC O
is O
quoted O
in O
our O
own O
clinics O
and O
we O
recommend O
that O
penetrance O
estimates O
are O
derived O
for O
the O
population O
being O
counselled O
. O

Our O
data O
are O
nonetheless O
at O
variance O
to O
a O
similar O
analysis O
carried O
out O
in O
North O
America O
. O

A O
series O
of O
1948 O
families O
were O
tested O
for O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
in O
eight O
centres O
. O
283 O
families O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
were O
identified O
and O
143 O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
authors O
used O
statistical O
modelling O
to O
arrive O
at O
penetrance O
figures O
by O
70 O
years O
of O
46 O
% O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
39-54 O
% O
) O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
43 O
% O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
36-51 O
% O
) O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
authors O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
any O
further O
testing O
of O
relatives O
in O
the O
family O
. O

Whilst O
they O
corrected O
for O
potential O
ascertainment O
bias O
, O
they O
did O
not O
allow O
for O
the O
effects O
of O
modifier O
genes O
in O
these O
families O
and O
purely O
looked O
at O
attributable O
risk O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
alone O
. O

This O
was O
based O
on O
the O
apparent O
lack O
of O
heterogeneity O
in O
another O
study O
of O
Jewish O
families O
from O
North O
America O
. O

What O
is O
particularly O
concerning O
is O
the O
risk O
attributed O
to O
`` O
non O
mutation O
carriers O
'' O
to O
70 O
years O
. O

A I-gene
figure O
of O
5 O
% O
as I-disease
a I-disease
general O
population O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
may O
have O
been O
correct O
20-30 O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
risk O
faced O
by O
women B-species
in O
the O
US O
or O
the O
UK O
today O
. O

Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
to O
age O
70 O
is O
7.6 O
% O
in O
the O
UK O
and O
nearer O
8 O
% O
in O
the O
US O
. O

A O
correction O
for O
this O
difference O
might O
give O
penetrance O
figures O
of O
nearer O
74 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
69 O
% O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
decision O
not O
to O
include O
any O
adjustment O
in O
these O
families O
for O
the O
effects O
of O
modifier O
genes O
is O
questionable O
. O

The O
difference O
in O
penetrance O
obtained O
from O
the O
BCLC O
and O
from O
population O
studies O
strongly O
suggests O
the O
presence O
of O
additional O
genetic O
factors O
in O
high-risk O
families O
. O

We O
have O
recently O
reported O
that O
those O
testing O
negative O
for O
a O
family O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
are O
still O
at O
3-fold O
relative O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
phenocopy O
effect O
was O
also O
seen O
in O
the O
Iceland O
data O
for O
their O
founder O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
, O
although O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
given O
the O
strong O
population O
based O
element O
of O
their O
analysis O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
modifier O
genes O
are O
more O
prevalent O
in O
some O
populations O
and O
that O
penetrance O
in O
North O
America O
is O
less O
affected O
by O
modifier O
genes O
than O
in O
the O
UK O
. O

The O
presence O
of O
these O
modifier O
alleles O
is O
now O
indisputable O
from O
recent O
genome O
wide O
association O
studies O
. O

A O
potential O
criticism O
of O
our O
study O
is O
that O
we O
have O
not O
taken O
enough O
account O
of O
ascertainment O
bias O
and O
that O
additional O
adjustment O
maybe O
necessary O
beyond O
excluding O
the O
index O
case O
. O

An O
analysis O
using O
these O
adjustments O
was O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
North O
American O
study O
and O
recent O
reports O
from O
the O
Cambridge O
group O
. O

These O
studies O
did O
not O
take O
into O
account O
the O
widespread O
testing O
of O
relatives O
and O
as O
explained O
above O
the O
American O
study O
deliberately O
excluded O
any O
effect O
other O
than O
of O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

Whilst O
it O
is O
clearly O
interesting O
to O
know O
the O
effect O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
alone O
, O
women B-species
undergoing O
testing O
will O
want O
to O
know O
what O
their O
own O
specific O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
, O
including O
that O
contributed O
by O
other O
potential O
`` O
modifier O
'' O
genes O
in O
their O
family O
. O

We O
must O
also O
acknowledge O
that O
confidence O
intervals O
in O
table O
3 O
should O
also O
be O
wider O
due O
to O
forcing O
the O
data O
on O
unknown O
FDRs O
into O
a O
known O
category O
. O

The O
high-risk O
women B-species
testing O
positive O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
the O
prospective O
part O
of O
our O
study O
. O

The O
2-2.7 O
% O
annual O
risk O
demonstrated O
is O
equivalent O
to O
the O
highest O
risk O
in O
a O
10-year O
period O
( O
23 O
% O
BRCA1 B-gene
; O
30 O
% O
BRCA2-Table O
3 O
) O
. O

Although O
most O
of O
the O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
were O
detected O
by O
screening O
, O
only O
one O
was O
detected O
at O
a O
prevalence O
mammogram O
. O

These O
follow O
up O
risks O
are O
also O
supported O
by O
a O
similar O
follow O
up O
study O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
where O
8 O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
occurred O
in O
63 O
mutation O
carriers O
with O
a O
calculated O
annual O
risk O
of O
2.5 O
% O
. O

Our O
own O
study O
and O
recent O
analyses O
from O
North O
America O
and O
Iceland O
demonstrate O
that O
women B-species
in O
the O
most O
recent O
birth O
cohort O
have O
a O
substantially O
higher O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
than O
past O
cohorts O
. O

The O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
has O
risen O
4 O
fold O
in O
80 O
years O
in O
Iceland O
( O
as O
has O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
general O
population O
) O
and O
we O
have O
observed O
a O
similar O
increase O
from O
< O
10 O
% O
risk O
by O
40 O
years O
in O
those O
born O
before O
1930 O
to O
a O
40 O
% O
risk O
on O
those O
born O
after O
1960 O
, O
although O
this O
was O
less O
significant O
after O
allowing O
for O
ascertainment O
bias O
. O

It O
is O
, O
therefore O
, O
inappropriate O
to O
quote O
risks O
as O
low O
as O
43-46 O
% O
( O
based O
on O
population O
studies O
) O
for O
lifetime O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
to O
women B-species
in O
their O
twenties O
or O
early O
thirties O
if O
they O
test O
positive O
for O
a O
mutation O
in O
a O
high-risk O
family O
. O

Another O
potential O
effect O
of O
earlier O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
might O
be O
a O
reduction O
in O
life O
expectancy O
. O

With O
increasing O
survival O
from O
birth O
in O
the O
general O
population O
and O
improved O
survival O
from O
diagnosis O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
we O
might O
have O
expected O
to O
see O
improved O
life O
expectancy O
. O

However O
, O
it O
would O
appear O
that O
these O
elements O
almost O
completely O
cancel O
each O
other O
out O
and O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
improved O
survival O
from O
birth O
in O
modern O
BRCA B-gene
birth O
cohorts O
. O

When O
discussing O
the O
higher O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
recent O
generations O
, O
it O
is O
nonetheless O
important O
to O
couch O
any O
discussion O
on O
risk O
in O
terms O
of O
future O
prospects O
for O
risk O
reduction O
by O
preventive O
measures O
. O

Increasing O
numbers O
of O
women B-species
are O
opting O
for O
risk O
reducing O
surgery O
particularly O
early O
RRO O
, O
which O
will O
substantially O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
both O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

It O
is O
also O
likely O
that O
new O
treatments O
or O
substantial O
changes O
from O
the O
Western O
lifestyle O
may O
have O
a O
sufficient O
effect O
to O
help O
in O
risk O
management O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Conclusion O
We O
believe O
our O
results O
show O
that O
when O
counselling O
women B-species
on O
their O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
if O
they O
carry O
a O
family O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
the O
risks O
should O
reflect O
the O
context O
of O
cancer O
in O
their O
family O
and O
not O
just O
an O
average O
risk O
from O
possibly O
over-corrected O
penetrance O
estimates O
from O
population O
studies O
. O

Indeed O
a O
recent O
review O
in O
a O
prestige O
journal O
quoted O
`` O
headline O
'' O
risks O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
of O
only O
40 O
% O
and O
8 O
% O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
to O
80 O
years O
. O

Understandably O
many O
clinicians O
and O
counsellors O
may O
quote O
these O
risks O
. O

The O
use O
of O

in O

to O

is O
already O
used O
in O
the O

The O

The O

There O
is O
also O
evidence O
that O

are O
at O

But O
even O
if O
the O

all O

taken O

it O
is O

that O

only O
20-25 O

Evidently O
other O

may O
exist O

However O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
the O
residual O
familial B-disease

is O
due O
to O
rare O
mutations O
conferring O
a O
high O
risk O
of O
the O

, O
similar O
to O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
, O
or O
to O
common O
but O
lower O
risk O
variants O
. O

In O
genetic O
counselling O
it O
is O
important O
to O
have O
an O
accurate O
genetic O
model O
on O
which O
to O
base O
estimates O
of O
mutation O
carrier O
probabilities O
and O
cancer O
risks O
. O

Such O
a O
model O
needs O
to O
incorporate O
both O
the O
effects O
of O
both O
the O
known O
susceptibility O
genes O
( O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
) O
and O
of O
other O
possible O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
genes O
. O

The O
existing O
genetic O
models O
are O
either O
based O
on O
a O
single O
susceptibility O
gene O
( O
Claus O
et O
al O
, O
1991 O
) O
or O
take O
into O
account O
only O
the O
effects O
of O

BRCA2 B-gene
( O
Parmigiani O

hence O
they O
do O
not O

DISCUSSION O
We O
investigated O
the O
genetic O
models O
for O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
a O
combined O
dataset O
consisting O
of O
both O
high-risk O
families O
and O
a O
population O
based O
series O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
. O

We O
found O
the O
most O
parsimonious O
model O
to O
be O
one O
with O
a O
polygenic O
component O
with O
an O
equal O
variance O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
and O
in O
non-carriers O
. O

This O
corresponds O
to O
a O
model O
in O
which O
several O
polymorphisms O
each O
act O
multiplicatively O
on O
risk O
( O
by O
for O
example O
, O
increasing O
the O
rate O
at O
which O
key O
mutational O
events O
will O
occur O
) O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
on O
carriers O
and O
non-carriers O
. O

A O
common O
recessive O
allele O
with O
moderate O
penetrance O
had O
the O
best O
fit O
among O
the O
major O
gene O
models O
fitted O
for O
'BRCA3 O
' O
. O

However O
, O
the O
evidence O
for O
a O
major O
gene O
is O
weakened O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
' O
B O
' O
families O
to O
the O
overall O
log-likelihood O
is O
always O
smaller O
under O
the O
major O
gene O
models O
for O
BRCA3 B-gene
than O
their O
contribution O
under O
the O
sporadic O
model O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
' O
B O
' O
families O
is O
larger O
under O
the O
polygenic O
models O
( O
with O
modifiers O
) O
than O
under O
the O
sporadic O
model O
. O

Under O
the O
best O
fitting O
model O
, O
the O
frequency O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
general O
population O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
0.051 O
% O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
: O
0.021-0.125 O
% O
) O
which O
corresponds O
to O
about O
one O
in O
974 O
individuals O
being O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
carrier O
. O

This O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
estimate O
of O
Ford O
et O
al O
( O
1995 O
) O
of O
one O
in O
800 O

Higher O
estimates O
were O
obtained O
by O

( O

% O
) O
and O
Antoniou O
et O
al O
( O
2000 O
) O
( O
0.13 O
% O
) O
. O

These O
studies O
were O
, O
however O
, O
based O
on O
segregation O
analysis O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
may O
be O
inflated O
by O
not O
allowing O
for O
other O
familial O
effects O
. O

The O
estimate O
from O
the O
ABC O
dataset O
alone O
was O
0.023 O
% O
( O
Antoniou O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
, O
lower O
than O
the O
estimate O
from O
our O
combined O
analysis O
but O
included O
in O
the O
confidence O
interval O
. O

The O
mutation O
frequency O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
0.068 O
% O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
: O
0.033-0.141 O
% O
) O
. O

This O
corresponds O
to O
one O
in O
734 O
individuals O
being O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
carrier O
in O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Again O
this O
is O
somewhat O
lower O
than O
0.17 O
% O
estimated O
in O
the O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
segregation O
analysis O
of O
Antoniou O
et O
al O
( O
2000 O
) O
( O
0.17 O
% O
) O
. O

The O
frequency O
from O
the O
ABC O
analysis O
alone O
was O
again O
somewhat O
lower O
, O
0.041 O
% O
( O
Antoniou O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
observed O
number O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
' O
B O
' O
families O
was O
higher O
than O
predicted O
might O
suggest O
that O
we O
have O
slightly O
underestimated O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
allele O
frequency O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
finding O
( O
by O
chance O
) O
too O
few O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
ABC O
study O
. O

Alternatively O
it O
may O
be O
that O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
mutation O
testing O
was O
lower O
in O
the O
much O
larger O
ABC O
study O
, O
although O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
why O
this O
should O
be O
true O
only O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

Under O
our O
best O
fitting O
model O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
, O
based O
on O
the O
average O
incidence O
over O
all O
modifying O
effects O
, O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
35.3 O
% O
by O
age O
70 O
years O
. O

This O
is O
moderately O
lower O
than O
the O
estimates O
derived O
by O
the O
BCLC O
studies O
of O
high O
risk O
families O
, O
which O
are O
in O
the O
range O
71-85 O
% O
( O
Easton O
et O
al O
, O
1993 O
, O
1995 O
) O
and O
also O
slightly O
lower O
than O
the O
estimates O
derived O
from O
risks O
to O
relatives O
of O
mutation O
carriers O
in O
population O
based O

of O

( O
Struewing O
et O
al O
, O
1997 O
; O
Hopper O
et O
al O
, O
1999 O
) O
. O

These O
differences O
are O
broadly O
consistent O
with O
our O
best O
model O
, O
since O
cases O
in O
high O
risk O
families O
will O
be O
expected O
to O
have O
a O
much O
larger O
polygenic O
component O
than O
average O
, O
while O
relatives O
of O
early O
onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
will O
be O
expected O
to O
have O
only O
a O
slightly O
higher O
polygenic O
component O
than O
average O
. O

The O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
is O
estimated O
to O
be O
26 O
% O
by O
age O

years O
. O

This O
is O
somewhat O
higher O
than O
the O
estimate O
of O
Struewing O
et O
al O
( O
1997 O
) O
but O
lower O
than O
the O
BCLC O
estimates O
( O
50.6-63.3 O
% O
) O
( O
Easton O
et O
al O
, O
1993 O
, O

. O

It O
is O
also O
lower O
than O
our O

on O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
( O
66 O

( O
Antoniou O

, O

) O
. O

The O
higher O
estimates O
from O
the O
last O
two O
studies O
are O
based O
on O
families O
that O
were O
selected O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
either O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
or O
number O
of O

ovarian I-disease

, O
and O
could O
be O
the O
result O
of O
modifying O
genes O
or O
other O
familial O
factors O
increasing O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risks O
. O

In O
principle O
, O
our O
model O
could O
be O
extended O
to O
account O
for O
such O
modifying O
factors O
. O

The O
cumulative O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
50.3 O
% O
by O
age O
70 O
years O
. O

Again O
this O
is O
lower O
than O
the O
BCLC O
estimates O
( O
Ford O
et O
al O
, O
1998 O
) O
but O
more O
similar O
to O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
population O
based O
study O
of O
Hopper O
et O
al O
( O
1999 O
) O
. O

The O
corresponding O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
by O
age O
70 O
years O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
9.1 O
% O
. O

This O
is O
lower O
than O
the O
first O
BCLC O
estimate O
( O
27 O
% O
) O
( O
Ford O
et O
al O
, O
1998 O
) O
and O
the O
estimate O
based O
on O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
( O
31 O
% O
) O
( O
Antoniou O
et O
al O
, O
2000 O
) O
. O

It O
is O
also O
somewhat O
lower O
than O
the O
estimate O
from O
a O
recent O
BCLC O
study O
of O
genotype-phenotype O
correlations O
( O
14 O
% O
) O
( O
Thompson O
and O
Easton O
, O
2001 O
) O
and O
the O
estimate O
of O
Struewing O
et O
al O
( O
1997 O
) O
based O
on O
carriers O
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
. O

We O
found O
that O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
incidence O
rates O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
relative O
to O
the O
population O
incidence O
rates O
decrease O
sharply O
with O
age O
. O

This O
contrasts O
with O
the O
pattern O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
in O
whom O
the O
relative O
risk O
is O
approximately O
constant O
over O
age O
40 O
years O
. O

Thus O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
estimated O
to O
confer O
a O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
population O
risk O
but O
10-12 O
times O
greater O
. O

This O
difference O
in O
the O
pattern O
of O
incidence O
rates O
is O
mirrored O
in O
the O
very O
different O
histopathology O
of O
tumours O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
( O
Lakhani O
et O
al O
, O
1998 O
) O
, O
and O
reflects O
important O
mechanistic O
differences O
. O

A O
practical O
implication O
of O
these O
different O
age-incidence O
patterns O
, O
is O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
develop O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
a O
younger O
age O
than O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

The O
polygenic O
model O
suggests O
that O
several O
genes O
, O
each O
having O
small O
but O
multiplicative O
effects O
on O
risk O
can O
account O
for O
the O
residual O
non-BRCA1/2 O
familial O
clustering O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Genes O
other O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
implicated O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
include O
the O
TP53 B-gene
gene O
( O
Malkin O
et O

) O
, O
and O
the O
PTEN B-gene
gene O
( O
Nelen O
et O
al O
, O
1996 O
) O
. O

Mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
, O
however O
, O
predispose O
to O
rare O
autosomal O
dominant O
syndromes O
and O
their O
contribution O
to O
familial O
aggregation O
is O
very O
small O
. O

Heterozygous O
carriers O
of O
the O
ataxia-talangiectasia B-disease
gene O
ATM B-gene
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
at O
increased O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O

1991 O
; O
Easton O
, O
1994 O

Olsen O

) O
and O
there O
is O
also O
evidence O
that O
rare O
HRAS1 B-gene

may O
be O
associated O
with O
moderate O
risks O
for O
breast B-disease

( O
Krontiris O

. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
genes O

In O

some O

However O
, O
some O
of O
the O
evidence O
for O
a O
recessive O

may O
be O
due O
to O
secular O
increase O
in O

, O
which O
would O
give O

to O
the O

It O
is O
also O
, O
of O

, O
possible O
that O
some O
of O
the O

modelled O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
present O
results O
suggest O
that O
a O
number O

may O
account O
for O
the O

The O

The O

The O

The O

the O

In O

Our O

Although O
our O

not O
sufficiently O
large O

The O

Previous O
studies O

DISCUSSION O
While O
the O
presence O
of O
genomic O
rearrangements O
in O
addition O
to O
point O
mutations O
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
has O
been O
well O
established O
, O
the O
proportion O
of O
women B-species
carrying O
mutations O
and O
their O
relative O
contribution O
to O
the O
total O
mutations O
in O
a O
United O
States O
based O
high O
risk O
clinic O
representative O
of O
the O
commercial O
testing O
population O
has O
not O
been O
determined O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
6 O
% O
of O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
with O
an O
estimated O
mutation O
prevalence O
over O
10 O
% O
had O
a O
genomic O
rearrangement O
, O
comprising O
8 O
% O
of O
those O
without O
an O
identified O
point O
mutation O
. O

Of O
importance O
, O
genomic O
rearrangements O
accounted O
for O
18 O
% O
of O
the O
mutations O
identified O
and O
their O
presence O
did O
not O
correlate O
with O
the O
estimated O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
. O

Specifically O
, O
six O
of O
the O
eight O
women B-species
with O
genomic O
rearrangements O
had O
an O
estimated O
mutation O
prevalence O
under O
30 O
% O
, O
and O
thus O
would O
not O
have O
been O
eligible O
for O
standard O
screening O
for O
genomic O
rearrangements O
, O
which O
is O
offered O
only O
to O
women B-species
with O
an O
estimated O
mutation O
prevalence O
over O
30 O
% O
( O
approximated O
from O
the O
Myriad O
Genetics O
criteria O
) O
. O

While O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
phenotypic O
predictors O
for O
genomic O
rearrangements O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
same O
as O
those O
for O
point O
mutations O
, O
we O
did O
not O
identify O
enough O
rearrangements O
to O
fully O
evaluate O
mutation O
predictors O
. O

Our O
data O
support O
the O
consideration O
of O
genomic O
rearrangement O
screening O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
for O
all O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
with O
an O
estimated O
mutation O
prevalence O
over O
10 O
% O
. O

The O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
group O
included O
sixteen O
( O
16/136 O
, O
12 O
% O
) O
probands B-species
of O
African O
American O
ethnicity O
. O

Among O
the O
African O
American O
families O
with O
a O
negative O
sequencing O
result O
, O
we O
detected O
one O
family O
with O
a O
genomic O
rearrangement O
( O
deletion B-mutation
of I-mutation
exons I-mutation
8-9 I-mutation
) O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
representing O
6 O
% O
of O
all O
African O
American O
families O
and O
16 O
% O
of O
all O
mutations O
identified O
in O
this O
group O
( O
1/6 O
) O
. O

Our O
data O
underline O
the O
need O
for O
larger O
studies O
to O
explore O
the O
contribution O
of O
genomic O
rearrangements O
to O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
spectra O
among O
minority O
populations O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

The O
rate O
of O
genomic O
rearrangements O
identified O
in O
this O
series O
is O
consistent O
with O
previous O
series O
from O
Europe O
and O
Australia O
, O
but O
lower O
than O
a O
previous O
United O
States O
based O
series O
, O
in O
which O
12 O
% O
of O
probands B-species
without O
point O
mutations O
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
rearrangement O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
discrepancy O
likely O
is O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
the O
study O
eligibility O
criteria O
. O

The O
previous O
study O
included O
families O
with O
at O
least O
four O
cases O
of O
female B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
and/or O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
whereas O
the O
current O
study O
included O
patients B-species
with O
an O
estimated O
prevalence O
of O
over O
10 O
% O
, O
which O
encompasses O
families O
with O
as O
few O
as O
two O
case O
of O
female O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
the O
conclusion O
of O
both O
studies O
is O
the O
same O
- O
that O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
without O
point O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
should O
be O
offered O
screening O
for O
genomic O
rearrangements O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting O
. O

While O
genomic O
rearrangements O
significantly O
contribute O
to O
the O
total O
number O
of O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
we O
did O
not O
identify O
any O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
probands B-species
negative O
for O
point O
mutations O
. O

Within O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
group O
, O
45 O
of O
47 O
( O
96 O
% O
) O
point O
mutations O
were O
founder O
mutations O
. O

Our O
data O
are O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies O
, O
demonstrating O
that O
the O
founder O
mutations O
account O
for O
more O
than O
90 O
% O
of O
mutations O
in O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
. O

In O
total O
, O
reported O
in O
the O
literature O
and O
including O
our O
study O
, O
99 O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
probands B-species
from O
high O
risk O
families O
have O
been O
negatively O
screened O
for O
genomic O
rearrangements O
. O

Thus O
, O
founder O
mutations O
continue O
to O
account O
for O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
all O
mutations O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Even O
if O
18 O
% O
of O
all O
detectable O
non-founder O
mutations O
in O
our O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
cohort O
were O
genomic O
rearrangements O
, O
they O
nevertheless O
would O
represent O
very O
rare O
events O
, O
accounting O
for O
0.72 O
% O
of O
mutations O
based O
on O
the O
prevalence O
of O
non-founder O
mutations O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
. O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
routine O
screening O
for O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
does O
not O
appear O
warranted O
in O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
. O

However O
, O
larger O
studies O
of O
this O
population O
need O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Empiric O
predictive O
models O
, O
such O
as O
Myriad O
II O
, O
Couch O
and O
Manchester O
Scoring O
System O
are O
intended O
to O
estimate O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
in O
a O
woman B-species
based O
on O
her O
family O
history O
and O
are O
used O
widely O
in O
clinical O
practice O
. O

Currently O
these O
models O
do O
not O
account O
for O
genomic O
rearrangements O
and O
as O
such O
underestimate O
the O
number O
of O
women B-species
with O
identifiable O
mutations O
, O
particularly O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

In O
addition O
, O
understanding O
the O
proportion O
of O
mutation O
that O
are O
missed O
using O
current O
methods O
to O
identify O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
is O
useful O
when O
counseling O
patients B-species
about O
their O
chances O
of O
being O
undetected O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Previous O
studies O
from O
the O
Breast O
Cancer O
Linkage O
Consortium O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
percentage O
of O
linked O
families O
with O
a O
detectable O
point O
mutation O
may O
be O
as O
low O
as O
65 O
% O
. O

However O
, O
the O
study O
was O
limited O
as O
various O
mutation O
detection O
techniques O
were O
used O
, O
some O
of O
which O
only O
detect O
60-65 O
% O
of O
mutations O
as O
compared O
to O
sequencing O
as O
a O
gold O
standard O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
these O
studies O
did O
not O
include O
genomic O
rearrangements O
and O
thought O
should O
be O
given O
to O
repeating O
them O
with O
improved O
mutation O
detection O
techniques O
and O
the O
larger O
spectrum O
of O
mutations O
now O
identified O
, O
so O
that O
women B-species
can O
be O
accurately O
counseled O
about O
their O
chances O
to O
carry O
an O
undetected O
mutation O
. O

We O
attempted O
to O
limit O
bias O
for O
and O
against O
mutations O
in O
our O
population O
by O
only O
including O
probands B-species
with O
a O
sample O
available O
in O
the O
laboratory O
and O
excluding O
any O
probands B-species
who O
themselves O
or O
any O
family O
member O
had O
prior O
genetic O
testing O
before O
being O
seen O
in O
CREP O
and O
having O
commercial O
testing O
. O

Due O
to O
our O
strict O
eligibility O
criteria O
, O
the O
number O
of O
probands B-species
available O
for O
study O
was O
restricted O
; O
as O
such O
, O
these O
findings O
will O
need O
to O
be O
replicated O
in O
a O
larger O
population O
. O

However O
, O
any O
such O
study O
will O
need O
to O
include O
systematic O
screening O
of O
a O
clearly O
defined O
population O
, O
so O
that O
the O
findings O
can O
be O
generally O
applied O
. O

While O
our O
study O
is O
based O
on O
a O
single O
high O
risk O
clinic O
population O
and O
thus O
limited O
, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
number O
of O
observed O
mutations O
does O
not O
significantly O
different O
than O
those O
expected O
in O
the O
commercial O
testing O
population O
based O
on O
the O
Myriad O
II O
model O
. O

The O
Myriad O
II O
model O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
perform O
similarly O
to O
BOADICEA O
and O
BRCAPRO O
; O
all O
of O
the O
models O
are O
limited O
in O
that O
they O
generally O
under O
predict O
mutations O
at O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
prediction O
probability O
and O
overestimate O
the O
upper O
ends O
. O

In O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
, O
the O
models O
did O
under O
predict O
the O
number O
of O
mutations O
at O
the O
lower O
end O
the O
mutation O
prevalence O
spectrum O
. O

Most O
models O
are O
limited O
to O
first- O
and O
second- O
degree O
relatives O
; O
however O
, O
in O
clinical O
practice O
family O
history O
characteristics O
of O
more O
distant O

are O
important O
in O
evaluating O
a O

. O

Overall O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
potentially O

probands B-species
provided O
a O

; O
86 O
% O
of O
the O
non-Ashkenazi O

The O
sampled O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
probands B-species
were O
representative O
of O
the O
entire O
potentially O

Ashkenazi O
Jewish O

. O

The O
non-sampled O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
probands B-species
did O
not O
differ O
in O
their O
estimated O
mutation O

, O
but O
did O
have O
fewer O

than O
the O

. O

However O
, O
including O
the O
non-sampled O
probands B-species
in O
the O
overall O

did O
not O
significantly O
affect O
the O

As O
such O

In O

Armstrong O

observed O
that O

in O
which O

increase O
the O

Growing O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
breast B-disease

is O
a O
heterogeneous O
disease O
with O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-associated O
tumors O
exhibiting O
a O

, O
while O

Paradoxically O
, O
estrogen O
suppression O
by O

in O

but O
also O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

The O
use O

has O
also O
been O

to O
reduce O
risk O
of O
contralateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene

Functional O
studies O
show O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene

Mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
may O
remove O
this O
inhibitory O
effect O
, O
thereby O
increasing O
epithelial O
proliferation O

In O

been O
shown O

Lastly O
, O
we O
are O
limited O
by O
the O
number O

, O
which O
precluded O
us O

was O
also O
prohibited O
by O
our O

, O
but O
merits O
attention O
in O
future O
studies O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O
investigate O
the O
role O
of O
OC O
and O
PMH O
use O
in O
the O
development O
of O

in O

. O

Additional O
strengths O
of O
this O
study O
include O
: O
systematic O
collection O
of O
data O
, O
careful O
matching O
of O
cases O
to O
controls O
, O
the O
abstraction O
of O
medical O
records O
to O
confirm O
cancer-free O
interval O
for O
controls O
and O
treatment O
history O
for O
both O
cases O
and O
controls O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
by O
limiting O
initial O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnoses O
to O
localized O
and O
regional O
disease O
and O
specifying O
a O
minimum O
interval O
of O
one O
year O
between O
first O
and O
second O
diagnosis O
of O
the O
case O
subjects O
, O
we O
limited O
the O
potential O
for O
misclassification O
of O
metastases O
as O
second O
primary O
cancers O
. O

This O
study O
has O
avoided O
biases O
associated O
with O
use O
of O
high-risk O
or O
selected O
populations O
by O
ascertaining O
cases O
and O
controls O
via O
multiple O
population-based O
cancer O
registries O
, O
which O
lends O
to O
greater O
generalizability O
of O
the O
findings O
. O

We O
have O
also O
implemented O
strong O
quality O
control O
procedures O
to O
ensure O
accurate O
genotyping O
of O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
observed O
no O
significant O
evidence O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
OC/PMH O
use O
on O
risk O
of O
contralateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
differs O
between O
non-carriers O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
because O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
a O
higher O
baseline O
risk O
of O
second O
breast O
primaries O
compared O
to O
non-carriers O
, O
the O
potential O
increased O
risks O
associated O
with O
OC O
use O
may O
be O
clinically O
relevant O
. O

These O
results O
merit O
further O
confirmation O
in O
larger O
studies O
of O
BRCA1/2-carriers O
with O

. O

Thus O

DISCUSSION O
Our O
study O
of O
the O

of O

RAD51-135c O
g I-mutation
polymorphism O
confirms O
the O
findings O
of O
two O
previous O
studies O
. O

We O
found O
about O
a O
two-fold O
elevated O
BC B-disease
risk O
among O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
with O
the O
RAD51-135c O
allele O
using O
COX O
proportional O
hazards O
models O
. O

In O
Kaplan-Meier O
survival O
analysis O
, O
the O
median O
age O
at O
BC B-disease

was O
significantly O
7 O
years O
younger O
among O
BRCA2-RAD51-135c O
, O
compared O
with O
BRCA2-RAD51-wt O
carriers O
. O

For O
comparison O
, O
we O
also O
report O
the O
estimated O
OR O
by O
logistic O
regression O
analysis O
, O
which O
was O
also O
elevated O
in O
BRCA2-RAD51-135c O
carriers O
; O
however O
, O
this O
was O
nonsignificant O
. O

The O
BRCA2-RAD51-135c O
comprised O
only O
11 O
cases O
rendering O
an O
unstable O
and O
nonsignificant O
OR O
using O
this O
model O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
since O
the O
unaffected O
carriers O
are O
at O
a O
substantial O
elevated O
lifetime O
risk O
for O
BC B-disease
, O
using O
a O
simple O
case-control O
analysis O
does O
not O
consider O
the O
age O
at O
onset O
in O
the O

, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
length O
of O
follow-up O
in O
the O

. O

The O
COX O

model O
takes O
into O

the O

, O
and O
therefore O
maybe O
more O
suitable O
for O

analyses O
in O

did O
not O

Wang O

This O
study O
included O
individuals O
of O
Polish O

with O

larger O

in O

, O

) O
compared O

and O
previously O
reported O
studies O
. O

The O
number O
of O
BRCA1-5382insC O
carriers O
in O
our O
study O
was O
too O
small O
for O
separate O
analysis O
. O

However O
, O
if O
these O
results O
are O
confirmed O
in O
additional O
and O
larger O
studies O
, O
the O
RAD51 B-gene
is O
the O
first O
modifier O
gene O
with O
opposite O
effects O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
compared O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

The O
biological O
effect O
of O
the O
RAD51-135g O
c I-mutation
SNP O
is O
currently O
unknown O
; O
however O
, O
since O
a O
similar O
modifying O
effect O
has O
been O
seen O
in O
three O
separate O
studies O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
it O
is O
a O
real O
risk O
modifier O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

The O
BRCA2 B-gene
has O
a O
distal O
role O
in O
DNA O
repair O
machinery O
( O
Davies O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

It O
directly O
interacts O
with O
the O
RAD51 O
protein O
through O
the O
BRC O
repeat O
domain O
and O
regulates O
the O
formation O
of O
RAD51 B-gene
nucleoprotein O
filaments O
, O
which O
are O
essential O
for O
DNA O
repair O
through O
homologous O
recombination O
. O

However O
, O
the O
direct O
function O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
in O
DSB O
repair O
is O
less O
clear O
, O
a O
more O
proximal O
role O
in O
sensing O
and O
regulation O
of O
cellular O
response O
to O
DNA O
damage O
has O
been O
suggested O
by O
several O
recent O
papers O
( O
reviewed O
by O
Venkitaraman O
, O
2002 O
) O
. O

The O
BRCA1-RAD51 O
complex O
contains O
no O
more O
than O
2-5 O
% O
of O
the O
cellular O
content O
of O
each O
molecule O
( O
Scully O
et O
al O
, O
1997 O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
biologically O
plausible O
that O
the O
effect O
of O
RAD51 B-gene
SNP O
is O
different O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
compared O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene

, O
although O
the O

. O

The O
authors O
suggest O
that O
the O
lack O
of O
effect O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

is O
because O
these O
genes O
are O
part O
of O
the O

pathway O
, O
which O
is O
already O
nonfunctioning O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

This O
contradicts O
our O
finding O
of O
a O

effect O
associated O
with O
the O
RAD51-135c O

. O

Several O
possible O
reasons O
may O
account O
for O
this O

. O

Impaired O
function O
of O
some O
but O
not O
all O
the O

may O
be O

BRCA1/BRCA2 O
allele O
, O
while O
there O
is O
still O
a O
functioning O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O

. O

Alternatively O
, O
the O
type O

may O
be O
important O

for O

a O

In O

Somatic O

the O

Methods O
The O

consisted O
of O
67 O
primary O
breast B-disease

with O
and O
without O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O

Results O
Classification O
of O
genomic O
profiles O
through O
cluster O
analysis O
revealed O
four O
subgroups O
, O
three O
of O
which O
displayed O
high O
genomic O
instability O
indices O
( O
GII O
) O
. O

Two O
of O
these O
GII-high O
subgroups O
were O
enriched O
with O
either O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2-related O
tumours O
whereas O
the O
third O
was O
not O
BRCA-related O
. O

The O
BRCA1-related O
subgroup O
mostly O
displayed O
non-luminal O
phenotypes O
, O
of O
which O
basal-like O
were O
most O
prominent O
, O
whereas O
the O
other O
two O
genomic O
instability O
subgroups O
BRCA2- O
and O
GII-high-III O
( O
non-BRCA O
) O
, O
were O
almost O
entirely O
of O
luminal O
phenotype O
. O

Analysis O
of O
genome O

patterns O
revealed O
similarities O
between O
the O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
subgroups O
, O
with O
long O
deletions O
being O
prominent O
. O

This O
contrasts O
with O
the O
third O
instability O
subgroup O
, O
not O
BRCA-related O
, O
where O
small O
gains O
were O
more O
prominent O
. O

Conclusions O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-related O
tumours O
develop O
largely O
through O
distinct O
genetic O
pathways O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
regions O
altered O
while O
also O
displaying O
distinct O
phenotypes O
. O

Importantly O
, O
we O
show O
that O
the O
development O
of O
a O
subset O
of O
sporadic O
tumours O
is O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
either O
familial O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
. O

Despite O
their O
differences O
, O
we O
observed O
clear O
similarities O
between O
the O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-related O
subgroups O
reflected O
in O
the O
type O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
acquired O
with O
deletions O
of O
long O
DNA O
segments O
being O
prominent O
. O

This O
suggests O
similarities O
in O
the O
mechanisms O
promoting O
genomic O
instability O
for O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-associated O
tumours O
, O
possibly O
relating O
to O
deficiency O
in O
DNA O
repair O
through O
homologous O
recombination O
. O

Indeed O
, O
this O
feature O
characterized O
both O
familial O
and O
sporadic O
tumours O
displaying O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2-like O
spectrums O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
these O
findings O
lies O
in O
the O
potential O
benefit O
from O
targeted O
therapy O
, O
through O
the O
use O
of O
agents O
leading O
to O
DNA O
double-strand O
breaks O
such O
as O
PARP O
inhibitors O
( O
olaparib O
) O
and O
cisplatin O
, O
for O
a O
much O
larger O
group O
of O
patients B-species
than O
the O
few O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene

. O

Introduction O
Germline O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
significantly O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Tumours O
derived O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
have O
generally O
lost O
the O
wild-type O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
alleles O
, O
respectively O
. O

These O
observations O
suggest O
important O
roles O
for O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
as O
tumour O
suppressors O
. O

The O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
products O
are O
both O
phosphorylated O
by O
ATR O
( O
ataxia B-disease
telangiectasia I-disease
and O
Rad3 O
related O
) O
which O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
is O
activated O
by O
DNA O
damage O
and O
stalled O
replication O
forks O
. O

BRCA1 O
is O
important O
in O
recruitment O
of O
various O
DNA O
repair O
proteins O
, O
including O
BRCA2 O
, O
to O
sites O
of O
DNA O
damage O
, O
whereas O
BRCA2 O
is O
crucial O
for O
catalysing O
the O
formation O
of O
RAD51 O
filaments O
on O
single-stranded O
DNA O
at O
the O
damaged O
sites O
. O

The O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
are O
linked O
within O
a O
network O
of O
protein O
interactions O
having O
a O
common O
objective O
of O
responding O
to O
DNA O
damage O
and O
stalled O
replication O
forks O
. O

Disruption O
of O
key O
elements O
within O
this O
network O
might O
explain O
why O
cells O
defective O
in O
either O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
display O
genomic O
instability O
and O
are O
sensitive O
to O
DNA O
damage O
that O
involves O
double-strand O
breaks O
. O

This O
has O
suggested O
potential O
therapeutic O
applications O
through O
the O
use O
of O
agents O
that O
lead O
to O
double-stranded O
DNA O
breaks O
such O
as O
PARP O
inhibitors O
, O
mitomycin O

and O
platinum O

. O

The O
involvement O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumour I-disease
development O
has O
been O
questioned O
because O
somatic O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
not O
been O
found O
. O

However O
, O
methylation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
promoter O
and O
loss O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
expression O
are O
significantly O
associated O
and O
occur O
frequently O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

We O
have O
previously O
reported O
on O
epigenetic O
silencing O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
through O
promoter O
methylation O
in O
about O
10 O
% O
of O
an O
unselected O
set O
of O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
epigenetic O
silencing O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
might O
be O
an O
alternative O
to O
somatic O
mutations O
as O
a O
mechanism O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
inactivation O
in O
sporadic O
cases O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
is O
negatively O
regulated O
by O
protein O
interactions O
with O
gene O
products O
of O
the O
EMSY B-gene
gene O
which O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
is O
frequently O
amplified O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

This O
suggests O
an O
important O
link O
between O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
and O
sporadic O
tumour O
development O
. O

Analyses O
of O
genomic O
and O
gene O
expression O
profiles O
in O
unselected O
sets O
of O
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
have O
revealed O
subgroups O
of O
biological O
and O
clinical O
relevance O
. O

These O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
expression O
profiles O
of O
tumours O
derived O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
strongly O
resemble O
those O
of O
sporadic O
basal-like O
tumours O
. O

This O
has O
suggested O
that O
underlying O
BRCA1 B-gene
abnormalities O
could O
promote O
sporadic O
basal-like O
tumour O
development O
. O

Supporting O
this O
notion O
is O
the O
finding O
that O
sporadic O
basal-like O
tumours O
frequently O
display O
a O
significantly O
reduced O
expression O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
and O
genomic O
instability O
. O

However O
, O
a O
subset O
of O
sporadic O
basal-like O
tumours O
do O
not O
display O
large-scale O
genomic O
instability O
which O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
represent O
a O
novel O
subtype O
of O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

Here O
, O
we O
have O
profiled O
and O
examined O
the O
patterns O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
in O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
in O
the O
context O
of O
sporadic O

with O

a O

We O
then O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
examine O
the O
potential O
involvement O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
in O
sporadic B-disease

A O
subset O
of O
sporadic O
tumours O
develop O
either O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2-like O
patterns O
of O
genomic O

Classification O
of O
genomic O
profiles O
through O
cluster O
analysis O
revealed O
four O
distinct O
subgroups O
of O
which O
two O
displayed O
high O
prevalence O
of O
tumours O
having O
either O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
abnormalities O
. O

These O
two O
subgroups O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-related O
subgroups O
respectively O
, O
displayed O
distinct O
patterns O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
and O
high O
instability O
indices O
. O

Importantly O
, O
our O
results O
show O
that O
sporadic O
tumours O
with O
epigenetic O
silencing O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
develop O
similar O
patterns O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
as O
tumours O
derived O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
inactivation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
through O
epigenetic O
silencing O
is O
an O
important O
event O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumour I-disease
development O
. O

We O
found O
two O
tumours O
within O
this O
genomic O
subgroup O
displaying O
loss O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
expression O
without O
promoter O
methylation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
and O
both O
of O
these O
tumours O
expressed O
the O
basal O
marker O
CK5/6 O
. O

Given O
the O
observations O
described O
above O
, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
speculate O
that O
sporadic O
tumours O
displaying O
BRCA1-like O
genomic O
alterations O
are O
promoted O
by O
defects O
linked O
with O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
function O
in O
genomic O
maintenance O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
one O
sporadic O
tumour O
classified O
among O
the O
BRCA2-related O
subgroup O
, O
which O
was O
otherwise O
exclusively O
comprised O
of O
tumours O
derived O
from O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

This O
tumour O
displayed O
a O
deletion O
at O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
locus O
and O
gains O
in O
EMSY B-gene
gene O
copy O
numbers O
. O

EMSY B-gene
gene O
products O
are O
known O
to O
interact O
with O
and O
negatively O
regulate O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
and O
this O
may O
link O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
with O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumour I-disease
development O
. O

Obviously O
, O
further O
research O
is O
needed O
to O
examine O
the O
relation O
between O
EMSY B-gene
amplification O
and O
BRCA2-like O
patterns O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
. O

BRCA-like O
genomic O
instability O
Although O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-related O
tumours O
develop O
through O
alterations O
affecting O
different O
regions O
in O
their O
genomes O
they O
showed O
similarities O
in O
their O
genomic O
architecture O
patterns O
with O
large O
segments O
of O
deletions O
being O
prominent O
. O

This O
suggests O
a O
similar O
mechanism O
by O
which O
these O
tumours O
acquire O
instability O
and O
we O
propose O
here O
that O
this O
might O
relate O
to O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
in O
error-free O
DNA O
repair O
of O

through O
HR O
( O
homologous O
recombination O
) O
. O

Inactivation O
of O
either O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
is O
generally O
thought O
to O
lead O
to O
the O
repair O
of O
double-strand O
breaks O
by O
error-prone O
mechanisms O
via O
non-homologous O
end O
joining O
. O

DNA O
repair O
of O
double-strand O
breaks O
by O
non-homologous O
end O
joining O
can O
lead O
to O
errors O
leading O
to O
gains O
or O
losses O
of O
large O
segments O
of O
genomic O
material O
. O

This O
mechanism O
could O
underlie O
the O
characteristic O
type O
of O
genomic O
instability O
observed O
within O
the O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-related O
subgroups O
. O

Alternative O
but O
not O
mutually O
exclusive O
interpretations O
relate O
to O
the O
proposed O
roles O
of O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
in O
telomere O
maintenance O
and O
centrosome O
division O
. O

By O

found O
to O
display O
increased O

which O
might O
relate O
to O
the O
previously O

did O
identify O
a O
cluster O
of O
tumours O
characterised O
by O
low O
genomic O
instability O
indices O
and O
non-luminal O
phenotypes O
. O

These O
tumours O
were O
mostly O
of O
basal-like O
phenotypes O
and O
displayed O
an O
aggressive O
phenotype O
in O
terms O
of O
disease O
outcome O
. O

This O
observation O
demonstrates O
that O
a O
subset O
of O
non-luminal O
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
do O
not O
develop O
towards O
large-scale O
genomic O
alterations O
supporting O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
these O
tumours O
represent O
biologically O
important O
disease O
entities O
. O

Tumours O
derived O
from O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
have O
previously O
been O
shown O
to O
primarily O
display O
luminal O
phenotypes O
and O
rarely O
overexpress O
HER-2 B-gene
gene O
products O
and O
these O
findings O
were O
confirmed O
here O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
observed O
two O
familial-BRCA2 O
tumours O
without O
deletion O
or O
allelic O
imbalance O
at O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
locus O
and O
these O
tumours O
did O
not O
display O
large-scale O
genomic O
instability O
. O

This O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
natural O
history O
of O
some O
familial O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
does O
not O
involve O
loss O
of O
the O
wild-type O
BRCA2 B-gene
allele O
or O
at O
least O
only O
partial O
loss O
as O
has O
been O
suggested O
before O
. O

In O
this O
relation O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
cells O
heterozygous O
for O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
phenotype O
. O

Taken O
together O
, O
this O
suggests O
that O
a O
small O
subset O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
could O
be O
promoted O
by O
haploinsufficiency O
for O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
. O

The O
combined O
analysis O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
and O
tumour O
phenotypes O
, O
presented O
here O
, O
show O
that O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-related O
tumours O
develop O
largely O
through O
different O
genetic O
pathways O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
regions O
altered O
, O
while O
also O
displaying O
distinct O
phenotypes O
. O

In O
light O
of O
the O
common O
roles O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
genomic O
maintenance O
, O
this O
suggests O
that O
the O
observed O
phenotypic O
differences O
impose O
selective O
advantages O
for O
genomic O
alterations O
at O
distinct O
regions O
in O
the O
context O
of O
instability O
generated O
by O
BRCA-deficiency O
. O

This O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
results O
described O
by O
Melchor O
and O
colleagues O
showing O
the O
importance O
of O
ER O
status O
in O
familial B-disease
and I-disease
sporadic I-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

However O
, O
we O
found O
two O
genomically O
distinct O
populations O
of O
luminal O
tumours O
that O
clearly O
differed O
in O
terms O
of O
PR O
expression O
. O

This O
finding O
is O
novel O
and O
demonstrates O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
factor O
in O
breast B-disease
tumour I-disease
development O
. O

Conclusions O
We O
have O
demonstrated O
using O
high-resolution O
genomic O
profiling O
coupled O
with O
analysis O
of O
tumour O
phenotypes O
that O
the O
development O
of O
a O
subset O
of O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
is O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
tumours O
derived O
from O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Tumours O
that O
develop O
BRCA1-like O
patterns O
of O
genomic O
alterations O
predominantly O
displayed O
high-grade O
, O
non-luminal O
phenotypes O
and O
high O
genomic O

. O

However O
, O
we O
also O
found O
a O
subset O
of O
high O
grade O
non-luminal O
tumours O
, O
mostly O
basal-like O
, O
that O
displayed O
very O
silent O
genomes O
characerised O
by O
low O
genomic O
instability O
indices O
supporting O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
novel O
subgroup O
of O
ER-negative O
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

Tumours O
within O
the O
BRCA1- O

BRCA2-related O
genomic O
subgroups O
were O
found O
to O
acquire O
genomic O
alterations O
affecting O
distinct O
regions O
of O
their O
genomes O
while O
also O
displaying O
distinct O
tumour O

. O

Given O
the O
common O
roles O
of O
the O
BRCA B-gene
gene O
products O
in O
genomic O
maintenance O
, O
this O
suggests O
that O
phenotypic O
differences O
between O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-associated O
tumours O
impose O
selective O
advantages O
for O
distinct O
genomic O
alterations O
in O
the O
context O
of O

generated O
by O
BRCA-deficiency O
. O

Despite O
these O
differences O
, O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genomic O
subgroups O
displayed O
clear O
similarities O
in O
their O
genome O
architecture O
patterns O
where O
large O
deletions O
were O
prominent O
suggesting O
a O
similar O
mechanism O
by O
which O
genomic O
instability O
is O
brought O
about O
, O
possibly O
relating O
to O
defects O
in O
DNA O
repair O
through O
HR O
. O

This O
genomic O
feature O
was O
observed O
in O
both O
familial O
and O
sporadic O
tumours O
displaying O
a O
BRCA1- O
or O
BRCA2-like O
spectrum O
of O
genomic O

. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
cells O
with O
defective O

HR O
, O

Background O
Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
malignancy O
among O
women B-species
in O
developed O
countries O
. O

A O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
important O
risk O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
these O
cancers O
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
about O
5 O
- O
10 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
may O
be O
due O
to O
inherited O
predisposition O
. O

In O
the O
context O
of O
high O
risk O
families O
studies O
have O
provided O
the O
evidence O
for O
at O
least O
two O
major O
cancer O
susceptibility O
genes O
: O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
17q21 O
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
13q12 O
) O
. O

The O
cumulative O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
for O
a O
woman B-species
carrying O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
is O
estimated O
to O
be O
as O
high O
as O
85 O
% O
by O
the O
age O
of O
70 O
years O
and O
female O
carriers O
are O
also O
at O
a O
substantially O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Since O
the O
initial O
identification O
of O
both O
genes O
more O
than O
3700 O
cancer O

have O
been O
reported O
to O
the O

So O

, O
most O
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
a O
single O
or O
a O
few O

at O
most O
. O

However O
, O
several O
founder O

are O
described O
in O

populations O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
, O
the O

and O
the O

. O

We O
have O
previously O
reported O
a O
highly O
recurrent O
BRCA2 B-gene
founder O
mutation O
for O
the O
Slovene O
population O
. O

Slovenia O
has O
two O
million O
inhabitants O
and O
every O
year O
close O
to O
1100 O
women B-species
are O
diagnosed O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Genetic O
counselling O
for O
inherited B-disease
breast/ovarian I-disease

in O
Slovenia O
started O
at O
the O
Institute O

the O

The O
first O

in O
implementing O
a O

The O
aim O

the O

Discussion O
Slovenia O
is O
a O
central O
European O
area O
country O
and O
despite O
a O
complex O
history O
of O
occupation O
throughout O
history O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
been O
an O
independent O
country O
for O
only O
17 O
years O
, O
the O
population O
has O
preserved O
its O
own O
language O
and O
culture O
for O
centuries O
. O

Currently O
83 O
% O
of O
the O
population O
is O
considered O
of O
Slovene O
origin O
. O

Most O
Slovenes O
live O
in O
the O
current O
Slovenia O
, O
but O
due O
to O
variations O
in O
the O
size O
of O
the O
country O
significant O
Slovene O
populations O
also O
live O
in O
surrounding O
countries O
especially O
Austria O
, O
northern O
Italy O
and O
also O
some O
Balkan O
countries O
. O

In O
this O
report O
we O
tested O
145 O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
in O
Slovenia O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
mutations O
. O

There O
was O
a O
striking O
high O
interest O
for O
genetic O
testing O
after O
providing O
systematic O
and O
standardized O
information O
using O
written O
material O
. O

Only O
5 O
probands B-species
( O
3.3 O
% O
) O
from O
150 O
families O
that O
met O
our O
inclusion O
criteria O
for O
screening O
refused O
mutation O
analysis O
. O

This O
level O
of O
participation O
is O
considerably O
higher O
than O
some O
report O
in O
the O
literature O
, O
where O
around O
50 O
% O
of O
eligible O
probands B-species
opt O
for O
screening O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
information O
about O
the O
screening O
was O
communicated O
on O
the O
adequate O
level O
of O
understanding O
. O

The O
high O
participation O
rate O
of O
probands B-species
contrasted O
sharply O
with O
the O
subsequent O
low O
interest O
in O
counselling O
of O
family O
members O
. O

Only O
an O
average O
of O
two O
possible O
or O
probable O
carriers O
per O
BRCA B-gene
1/2 I-gene
mutation O
positive O
family O
came O
forward O
spontaneously O
to O
request O
testing O
. O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
lack O
of O
interest O
are O
not O
known O
, O
as O
we O
did O
not O
investigate O
this O
on O
our O
population O
. O

Adequate O
proband-based O
information O
dissemination O
in O
a O
proband B-species
mediated O
model O
was O
identified O
in O
Belgium O
by O
Sermijn O
et O
al O
. O
as O
highly O
anomalous O
. O

That O
study O
showed O
that O
in O
reality O
the O
interest O
in O
counselling O
and O
testing O
was O
high O
as O
almost O
all O
relatives O
wanted O
to O
be O
further O
informed O
about O
the O
various O
aspects O
concerning O
hereditary B-disease
breast/ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
also O
subsequently O
requested O
a O
genetic O
test O
after O
being O
properly O
informed O
. O

This O
also O
agrees O
with O
our O
high O
participation O
rate O
observed O
in O
the O
properly O
informed O
probands B-species
. O

Since O
we O
often O
face O
genetic O
counselling O
for O
members O
of O
small O
families O
, O
we O
applied O
minimal O
selection O
criteria O
before O
initiating O
a O
search O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Despite O
these O
liberal O
criteria O
the O
overall O
mutation O
detection O
rate O
( O
MDR O
) O
was O
39 O
% O
( O
56/145 O
screened O
families O
) O
, O
which O
is O
high O
when O
compared O
to O
what O
was O
previously O
reported O
for O
other O
populations O
where O
the O
MDR O
are O
between O
15 O
% O
and O
37 O
% O
with O
usually O
more O
stringent O
selection O
criteria O
with O
regard O
to O
familial O
cancer O
phenotype O
than O
in O
our O
study O
. O

The O
intake O
criteria O
we O
employed O
thus O
seemed O
adequate O
and O
practical O
for O
further O
use O
in O
our O
population O
. O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
with O
our O
mutation O
screening O
methodology O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
all O
possible O
mutations O
and O
thus O
we O
have O
a O
lower O
estimate O
of O
the O
mutation O
rate O
in O
our O
population O
. O

For O
the O
same O
reason O
the O
actual O
mutation O
heterogeneity O
could O
be O
greater O
than O
we O
estimate O
. O

It O
is O
known O
and O
was O
also O
observed O
in O
the O
current O
series O
, O
that O
the O
best O
MDR O
were O
obtained O
in O
families O
with O
either O
a O
high O
number O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
or O
families O
that O
also O
include O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
in O
which O
case O
the O
number O
of O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
is O
of O
lesser O
importance O
. O

Such O
a O
high O
MDR O
of O
> O
50 O
% O
in O
families O
that O
also O
include O
at O
least O
one O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
case O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
in O
other O
populations O
. O

However O
, O
more O
Slovene O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
only O
families O
were O
found O
mutation-positive O
as O
compared O
with O
comparable O
Belgian O
families O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
high O
MDR O
in O
this O
type O
of O
families O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
occurrence O
of O
a O
highly O
recurrent O
founder O
mutation O
in O
the O
Slovene O
families O
that O
predispose O
almost O
exclusively O
and O
at O
high O
penetrance O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
IVS16-2A B-mutation
> I-mutation
G I-mutation
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
) O
since O
ignoring O
the O
families O
with O
this O
mutation O
leads O
to O
comparable O
MDR O
for O
both O
populations O
. O

We O
found O
2 O
novel O
large O
deletions B-mutation
involving I-mutation
exons I-mutation
5-8 I-mutation
and I-mutation
5-10 I-mutation
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
that O
probably O
occurred O
through O
a O
recombination O
event O
between O
misaligned O
repetitive O
elements O
( O
Alu O
repeats O
) O
abundant O
within O
the O
intron O
sequences O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

Four O
distinct O
types O
of O
mutations O
occurred O
very O
frequently O
in O
the O
Slovene O
population O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
analysis O
of O
only O
4 O
PCR O
fragments O
( O
1806C B-mutation
> I-mutation
T I-mutation
, O
exon O

300T B-mutation

, O
5382insC B-mutation
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
and O
IVS16-2A B-mutation
> I-mutation
G I-mutation
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene

) O
would O
lead O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
cancer O
predisposing O
mutations O
in O
67 O
% O
of O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation-positive O
families O
. O

Therefore O
the O
genetic O
screening O
was O
initiated O
with O
the O
detection O
of O
these O
four O
particular O
DNA O
regions O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
families O
that O
do O
not O
strictly O
meet O
the O
including O
criteria O
for O
the O
genetic O
screen O
can O
be O
submitted O
to O
a O
restricted O
analysis O
when O
cost-effectiveness O
is O
an O
issue O
and O
a O
mutation O
screen O
would O
otherwise O
not O
be O
engaged O
. O

Earlier O
in O

we O
discovered O
a O

This O
nonsense O
mutation O
clusters O
mainly O
in O
Sweden O
, O
and O
is O
reported O
as O
a O

. O

The O
mutation O
however O
has O
also O
been O
found O
in O
Belgian O

, O
and O
according O
to O

in O
German O
, O
Austrian O
, O
Dutch O
, O
Danish O
and O
Italian O
ethnic O

as O

We O
found O
an O
exceptionally O
high O
proportion O
( O
37 O
% O
) O
of O
pathogenic O
missense O

in O
the O
RING O

Interestingly O
, O
each O

One O
of O

A I-mutation
, O
was O
found O
in O
5 O

and O
has O
not O

According O
to O
the O
data O
available O
in O

and O
from O
the O

, O
such O
a O
high O
frequency O
and O

of O

is O
reported O
Italy O
, O

and O
in O

, O

, O

As O
the O
Slovene O
population O
mixed O
to O
some O
extent O
with O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
neighbouring O
countries O
( O
Austria O
, O
Italy O
, O
Hungary O
and O
Croatia O
) O
we O
can O
assume O
that O
we O
also O
share O
some O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
with O
these O
populations O
. O

Indeed O
, O
all O
three O
most O
common O
mutations O
found O
( O
except O
for O
the O
Slovenian O
founder O

) O
in O
Slovenians B-species
segregate O
in O
Italian O
and O
Austrian O
families O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
data O
on O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
from O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
Balkan O
region O
. O

There O
were O
only O
few O
reports O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

screening O
in O
the O
region O
of O
former O
Yugoslavia O
and O
by O
comparing O
results O
the O
only O
common O

found O
was O
BRCA1 B-gene
5382insC B-mutation
, O
which O
is O
known O
as O
an O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
mutation O
that O
occurs O
frequently O
in O
the O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe O
( O
Czech O
Republic O
, O
Lithuania O
, O
Poland O
, O

) O
. O

This O
mutation O
accounts O
for O
5/56 O
( O
9 O
% O
) O
positive O
families O
in O
our O
series O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
familial O
cancer O

this O
relatively O
small O
cohort O
does O
not O
allow O
for O
the O
uncovering O
of O
subtle O
differences O
between O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

families O
, O
except O
for O
the O
double O

in O

compared O
to O

as O
reported O
widely O
before O
. O

Families O
with O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
give O
rise O
to O
a O
multi-site O
cancer O

, O
which O
includes O
besides O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O

, O
as O
reported O
before O
. O

In O
our O
sample O
uterine B-disease
cancer I-disease
was O
related O
to O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

mutation O
. O

Both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
positive O
families O
included O
cases O
of O

that O
accounted O
for O
about O
2 O
percent O

. O

In O
one O

with O
5382insC B-mutation
BRCA1 B-gene

2 O

Interpretation O
of O
these O
results O
and O
risk O
assessment O
for O
these O
other O
cancers O
is O
difficult O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the O
low O

It O
is O
known O
that O
the O

might O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O
location O

This O
has O
resulted O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
Jewish O
genetic O

which O
evolved O
over O

When O
comparing O

, O
the O

Prostate B-disease

is O
a O

and O

be O
of O

Therefore O
, O
we O

in O

one O
study O
where O
a O
slight O

significant O
excess O
of O
BRCA1:5382insC O

was O
observed O
. O

However O
, O
all O
studies O
were O
small O
, O
and O
lack O
of O
power O
may O
have O
prevented O
some O
differences O
from O

We O

combined O
our O
results O
with O
observations O
in O
cases O
and O
, O
when O
available O
, O
controls O
from O
these O
studies O
. O

In O

, O
we O
compiled O
data O
from O
various O
reports O
which O
previously O
examined O
mutation O
frequencies O
in O
unselected O
AJ O

There O
were O
no O

the O

were O
used O
by O
the O

as O
sources O

. O

Hubert O
et O

selected O
a O
group O
of O
87 O
healthy O
elderly O
Israeli O
men B-species
( O
median O
age O
71 O
years O
) O
with O
no O
history O
of O
cancer O
as O
controls O
, O
thereby O
attempting O
to O
compensate O
for O
possible O
age-related O
variations O
in O
mutation O
frequencies O
. O

The O
larger O
populations O
studies O
performed O
mutation O
testing O
on O
AJ O
individuals O
from O
either O
the O
US O
or O
Israel O
( O
or O
both O
) O
who O
were O
referred O
for O
unrelated O
genetic O
testing O
( O
e.g O
. O

Tay O
Sachs O
, O
Cystic O

) O
, O
with O
no O
information O
available O
on O
gender O
, O
age O
or O
cancer O
history O
for O
these O
participants B-species
. O

Since O
genetic O
testing O
for O
the O
recessive O
conditions O
listed O
above O
would O
usually O
be O
undertaken O
prior O
to O
making O
the O
decision O
of O
having O
children B-species
, O
this O
larger O
group O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
lower O
median O
age O
than O
that O
observed O
in O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
. O

This O
group O
should O
, O
however O
, O
otherwise O
provide O
representative O
population O
frequencies O
for O
the O
mutations O
. O

Finally O
, O
controls O
from O
Struewing O
et O
al O
were O
AJ O
volunteers O
from O
the O
Washington O
D.C. O
area O
who O
wished O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
study O
on O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
authors O
acknowledge O
that O
such O
a O
recruitment O
scheme O
led O
to O
a O
higher O
than O
expected O
proportion O
of O
participants B-species
reporting O
a O
personal O
or O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
may O
conceivably O
result O
in O
an O
exaggerated O
mutation O
frequency O
in O
this O
control O
group O
compared O
to O
frequencies O
in O
the O
general O
population O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
participants B-species
in O
this O
control O
group O
included O
a O
number O
of O
siblings O
and O
relatives O
, O
including O
some O
who O
were O
mutation O
carriers O
, O
potentially O
further O
increasing O
the O
apparent O
frequency O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
this O
cohort O
. O

We O
therefore O
compared O
the O
mutation O
frequencies O
in O
volunteers O
from O
the O
Washington O
D.C. O
area O
to O
frequencies O
obtained O
from O
combining O
results O
from O
our O
other O
sources O
of O
controls O
to O
determine O
if O
frequencies O
from O
the O
volunteer O
group O
were O
different O
from O
those O
from O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Frequencies O
for O
BRCA1:185delAG O
and O
BRCA2:6174delT O
were O
slightly O
lower O
in O
the O
volunteer O
group O
, O
although O
the O
difference O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
BRCA1:5382insC O
mutation O
was O
significantly O
over-represented O
in O
volunteer O
controls O
compared O
to O
random O

% O
CI O
: O
1.1-13 O
; O
P O
= O

) O
. O

In O
consequence O
, O
we O
compared O
our O
combined O
cases O
to O
controls O
once O
again O
, O
this O
time O
excluding O
control O
data O
from O
the O

. O

While O
there O
was O
no O
change O
for O
BRCA1:185delAG O
and O
BRCA2:6174delT O
, O
we O
now O
observed O
a O

between O
the O
low O

. O

However O
, O
as O
indicated O
by O
the O

confidence O
interval O
, O
this O
effect O
is O
driven O
entirely O
by O

observed O
by O

report O
of O

across O
3 O
studies O
. O

According O
to O
the O
authors O
, O
neither O
carrier O
has O
a O
family O
history O
of O
prostate B-disease

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
reconcile O
our O

previous O
epidemiological O
studies O
suggesting O
an O
increased O
prostate B-disease

in O

. O

One O
possible O
explanation O
may O
be O
that O
a O
diagnostic O
bias O
exists O
in O
families O
where O
hereditary O
cancer O
cases O
are O
found O
. O

Specifically O
, O
having O
a O
relative O
affected O
with O
BRCA1/2-related O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
may O
encourage O
relatives O
to O
undergo O
testing O
and O
reveal O
the O
existence O
of O
prostate B-disease
tumors I-disease
which O
may O
otherwise O
have O
remained O
asymptomatic O
and O
undetected O
, O
thereby O
artificially O
increasing O
the O
incidence O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
in O
families O
bearing O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

If O
there O
were O
a O
significant O
decline O
in O
the O
mutation O
frequency O
of O
founder O
BRCA1 B-gene
and/or O
BRCA2 B-gene

Jewish O
males O
, O
then O
it O
is O

We O

Almost O
all O

BRCA1 B-gene

( O

displayed O
BRCA1 B-gene

Thus O
, O
epigenetic O

and O
deletion O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

might O
serve O
as O
Knudson O

We O
observed O

Introduction O
Germline O
mutations O
in O
one O
allele O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
significantly O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Tumour O
cells O
from O
predisposed O
individuals O
have O
consistently O
lost O
the O
wild-type O
BRCA B-gene
allele O
. O

The O
most O
prominent O
feature O
of O
BRCA B-gene
deficient O
cells O
is O
the O
inability O
to O
repair O
DNA O
cross-links O
and O
DNA O
double-strand O
breaks O
by O
error-free O
homologous O
recombination O
, O
which O
probably O
underlies O
genomic O
instability O
and O
cancer O
predisposition O
. O

Survival O
of O
BRCA B-gene
deficient O
cells O
is O
generally O
thought O
to O
be O
dependent O
upon O
dysfunctional O
checkpoint O
mechanisms O
, O
in O
which O
case O
tumorigenic O
potential O
could O
be O
acquired O
through O
additional O
genomic O
rearrangements O
and O
gene O
mutations O
. O

Indeed O
, O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
are O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O
TP53 B-gene
checkpoint O
gene O
, O
supporting O
the O
notion O
that O
genomic O
instability O
is O
an O
important O
driving O
force O
in O
early-onset O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumorigenesis O
. O

Although O
inherited O
cancer O
syndromes O
are O
rare O
, O
the O
genes O
accounting O
for O
them O
are O
generally O
believed O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
sporadic O
cancer O
. O

It O
was O
anticipated O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
somatic O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
would O
be O
found O
to O
contribute O
to O
sporadic O
breast O
carcinogenesis O
. O

Surprisingly O
, O
somatic O
BRCA B-gene
gene O
mutations O
have O
not O
been O
found O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
allelic O
imbalance O
( O
AI O
) O
at O
the O
BRCA B-gene
loci O
, O
an O
indicator O
for O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
, O
is O
know O
to O
be O
a O
fairly O
common O
event O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
implications O
of O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA B-gene
loci O
are O
unknown O
since O
Knudson O
's O
hypothesis O
predicts O
an O
additional O
inactivating O
event O
on O
top O
of O
AI O
to O
be O
required O
for O
tumorigenesis O
to O
occur O
. O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
has O
been O
questioned O
. O

An O
alternative O
mechanism O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
inactivation O
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
be O
gene O
silencing O
by O
epigenetic O
mechanisms O
. O

Hypermethylation O
of O
CpG-island O
promoters O
is O
known O
to O
be O
strongly O
associated O
with O
gene O
silencing O
. O

Once O
established O
, O
methylation O
is O
passed O
on O
to O
daughter O
cells O
during O
DNA O
replication O
by O
the O
activity O
of O
DNA O
methyltransferases O
, O
thereby O
conserving O
the O
overall O
pattern O
of O
methylated O
CpG-islands O
. O

The O
methylation O
patterns O
of O
virtually O
all O
types O
of O
cancer O
, O
including O
breast B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
have O
been O
found O
to O
differ O
extensively O
from O
that O
of O
the O
corresponding O
normal O
tissue O
. O

These O
alterations O
are O
cancer-type O
specific O
and O
include O
global O
genomic O
hypomethylation O
as O
well O
as O
non-random O
hypermethylation O
of O
normally O
unmethylated O
CpG-island O
promoters O
. O

These O
observations O
, O
and O
others O
, O
indicate O
that O
epigenetic O
modifications O
could O
be O
important O
in O
cancer O
etiology O
. O

Several O
studies O
have O
reported O
hypermethylation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
promoter O
in O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

Furthermore O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylation O
has O
only O
been O
found O
in O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
tumours I-disease
and O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
and O
reduced O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
expression O
. O

BRCA2 B-gene
promoter O
hypermethylation O
has O
not O
been O
found O
in O
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
, O
although O
it O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
ovarian B-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

Familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
are O
associated O
with O
young O
age O
of O
onset O
and O
are O
phenotypically O
distinct O
from O
each O
other O
as O
well O
as O
from O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
tumours I-disease
. O

Conventional O
histopathological O
and O
molecular O
analyses O
have O
demonstrated O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
to O
have O
a O
basal-like O
phenotype O
and O
to O
be O
significantly O
associated O
with O
certain O
features O
, O
such O
as O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
, O
a O
negative O
estrogen O
receptor O
( O
ER O
) O
and O
progesterone O
receptor O
( O
PR O
) O
status O
, O
a O
medullary O
tumour O
histological O
type O
, O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
and O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
mutation O
involved O
, O
a O
high O
tumour O
grade O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
gene O
expression O
profiling O
has O
revealed O
similarities O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylated O
and O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
. O

Similarly O
, O
a O
comparative O
genomic O
hybridisation O
study O
has O
reported O
a O
specific O
pattern O
of O
genetic O
alterations O
to O
be O
predictive O
of O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylated O
tumours O
. O

This O
lends O
support O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
epigenetic O
silencing O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
might O
channel O
tumour O
progression O
, O
akin O
to O
an O
underlying O
BRCA1 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
resulting O
in O
a O
BRCA-like O
phenotype O
. O

However O
, O
a O
recent O
report O
showing O
high O
levels O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
expression O
and O
a O
low O
frequency O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
promoter O
methylation O
in O
basal-like O
sporadic O
tumours O
suggests O
that O
this O
might O
be O
more O
complex O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
, O
we O
examined O
the O
frequency O
of O
BRCA1alpha O

hypermethylation O
in O

All O

a O

This O
is O

that O

not O
infer O
a O

it O

AI O
at O
the O

The O
implications O
of O

at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

for O

Knudson O

hypothesis O
predicts O
that O
two O

. O

Our O
results O
confirm O
that O
AI O

A O

( O

Importantly O
, O
we O
found O
an O
indication O
for O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene

( O

This O

suggests O
that O
AI O

Thus O

Knudson O

which O
has O
previously O

proposed O
by O
Esteller O

Indeed O
, O
all O

one O

also O
had O
a O

deletion O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

Collectively O
, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
is O
implicated O
in O
sporadic O
breast O
tumorigenesis O
through O
epigenetic O
silencing O
and O
deletion O
of O

Indications O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylation O
is O
important O
in O
hereditary B-disease

have O
been O
reported O
. O

The O
failure O
to O
detect O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
deletion O
in O
one O
of O
the O
tumours O
that O
exhibited O
absent O
or O
markedly O
reduced O
BRCA1 B-gene
expression O
could O
mean O
that O
promoter O
hypermethylation O
is O
present O
on O
both O
alleles O
, O
thereby O
alleviating O
any O
selection O
pressure O
for O
deletion O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
the O
level O
of O
detection O
in O
the O
FISH O
analysis O
could O
be O
limited O
by O
the O
small O
proportion O
of O
tumour O
cells O
present O
in O
each O
tumour O
section O
analysed O
. O

This O
might O
also O
apply O
for O
those O
tumours O
in O
which O
AI O
was O
present O
without O
a O
detectable O
deletion O
by O
FISH O
. O

Conversely O
, O
the O
detection O
level O
of O
the O
AI O
analysis O
was O
limited O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
none O
of O
the O
tumours O
were O
micro/macrodissected O
prior O
to O
DNA O
isolation O
, O
which O
also O
means O
that O
unmethylated O
BRCA1 B-gene
alelles O
are O
always O
detected O
in O
the O
tumour O
samples O
due O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
normal O
DNA O
. O

The O
four O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylated O
tumours O
that O
did O
not O
exhibit O
significantly O
reduced O
BRCA1 B-gene
expression O
could O
possibly O
be O
heterogenous O
with O
respect O
to O
this O
alteration O
. O

None O
of O
the O
four O
tumours O
exhibited O
BRCA1 B-gene
deletion O
by O
FISH O
and O
only O
one O
displayed O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
DNA O
methylation O
might O
not O
bring O
about O
transcriptional O
silencing O
in O
all O
instances O
. O

Although O
the O
etiology O
of O
cancer O
predisposition O
in O
individuals O
carrying O
a O
germline O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
is O
not O
clear O
, O
increased O
genomic O

undoubtedly O
of O

it O

to O
result O

probability O

further O
genetic O
alterations O

, O
which O
might O
result O
in O
functional O
consequences O
by O
which O

the O

It O
has O

that O
breast B-disease

Conclusion O
Our O
results O
show O
promoter O
hypermethylation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

in O
a O
considerable O
proportion O
of O
all O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylated O
tumours O
were O
found O
to O
have O
absent O
or O
markedly O
reduced O
BRCA1 B-gene
expression O
, O
suggesting O
transcriptional O
silencing O
by O
epigenetic O
modifications O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
found O
an O
indication O
for O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylation O
whereas O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
locus O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylation O
. O

This O
indicates O
that O
AI O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
is O
specifically O
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylation O
. O

The O
genetic O
alterations O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
were O
further O
examined O
by O
FISH O
, O
which O
revealed O
chromosome O
17 O
deletions O
and O
heterogeneity O
with O
respect O
to O
chromosomal O
abnormalities O
. O

These O
results O
imply O
that O
methylation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
is O
accompanied O
by O
genomic O
rearrangements O
at O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
locus O
, O
resulting O
in O
loss O
of O
genetic O
material O
containing O
non-methylated O
BRCA1 B-gene
alleles O
and O
retention O
of O
methylated O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

We O
also O
found O
a O
substantially O
elevated O
frequency O
of O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
subset O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylated O
tumours O
, O
which O
has O
not O
been O
reported O
previously O
, O
suggesting O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
methylation O
might O
lead O
to O
alterations O
in O
the O
same O
molecular O
pathways O
as O
those O
known O
to O
be O
commonly O
altered O
in O
familial O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
. O

Collectively O
, O
these O
results O
implicate O
epigenetic O
silencing O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
in O
sporadic O
breast O
tumorigenesis O
. O

Medullary O
histological O
type O
was O
not O
found O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

However O
, O
we O
observed O
ER O
negativity O
to O
be O
significantly O
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

We O
also O
found O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

to O
be O
of O

and O
an O

for O
an O
association O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene

and O

. O

Thus O

our O

The O

based O

. O

Our O
study O
and O
those O
of O
Narod O
et O
al O
share O
some O
limitations O
. O

First O
, O
they O
included O
data O
only O
from O
living O
affected O
carriers O
because O
of O
the O
difficulty O
of O
obtaining O
accurate O
histories O
from O
relatives O
of O
deceased O
patients B-species
. O

These O
living O
patients B-species
were O
prevalent O
cases O
who O
reported O
their O
prediagnostic O
oral O
contraceptive O
histories O
some O
time O
after O
their O
cancer O
diagnoses O
. O

If O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
altered O
mortality O
in O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
then O
this O
selection O
strategy O
may O
result O
in O
a O
biased O
odds-ratio O
estimate O
. O

Second O
, O
most O
study O
subjects O
were O
members O
of O
families O
with O
multiple O
cases O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
mutations O
in O
the O
women B-species
we O
have O
studied O
may O
have O
been O
those O
that O
cause O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
these O
cancers O
. O

Odds-ratios O
for O
oral O
contraceptive O
uses O
in O
these O
carriers O
may O
not O
pertain O
to O
the O
general O
population O
of O
carriers O
. O

Third O
, O
some O
of O
the O
unaffected O
carriers O
were O
relatives O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
. O

While O
this O
design O
limits O
potential O
confounding O
by O
ethnicity O
, O
a O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
correlation O
among O
sisters O
in O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
could O
distort O
both O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
association O
and O
the O
lengths O
of O
confidence O
intervals O
. O

Yet O
we O
found O
only O
modest O
correlation O
between O
sisters O
in O
duration O
of O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
our O
inclusion O
of O
control O
carriers O
who O
had O
undergone O
prophylactic O
oophorectomy O
could O
overestimate O
the O
protection O
afforded O
by O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
, O
if O
these O
carriers O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
use O
oral O
contraceptives O
than O
other O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
we O
found O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
prevalence O
of O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
between O
carriers O
with O
and O
without O
prophylactic O
oophorectomy O
. O

The O
studies O
by O
Modan O
et O
al O
( O
2001 O
) O
and O
McGuire O
et O
al O
( O
2004 O
) O
avoided O
these O
limitations O
by O
including O
only O
incident O
cases O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
mutation O
carriers O
and O
unrelated O
controls O
. O

Prevalence O
of O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
among O
carrier O
cases O
was O
compared O
to O
that O
in O
control O
women B-species
from O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Inferences O
based O
on O
such O
a O
comparison O
are O
valid O
only O
if O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
is O
similar O
among O
carriers O
and O
noncarriers O
in O
the O
general O
population O
. O

The O
null O
findings O
of O
Modan O
et O
al O
( O
2001 O
) O
may O
have O
occurred O
because O
the O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
of O
carrier O
cases O
was O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
controls O
who O
were O
older O
than O
they O
were O
. O

This O
difference O
occurred O
because O
controls O
were O
age-matched O
to O
all O
cases O
, O
whereas O
the O
carrier O
cases O
were O
younger O
than O
the O
noncarrier O
cases O
, O
and O
the O
analytic O
comparisons O
were O
stratified O
only O
in O
broad O
10-year O
age O
categories O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
comparison O
controls O
were O
born O
earlier O
than O
the O
carrier O
cases O
, O
and O
had O
less O
opportunity O
for O
long-term O
exposure O
to O
oral O
contraceptives O
, O
which O
did O
not O
become O
widespread O
until O
after O
1960 O
. O

This O
problem O
was O
mitigated O
in O
the O
report O
of O
McGuire O
et O
al O
( O
2004 O
) O
by O
the O
more O
recent O
birth O
years O
of O
all O
subjects O
, O
and O
by O
finer O
age O
stratification O
in O
the O
analysis O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
we O
found O
reduced O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
associated O
with O
long-term O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
among O
carriers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Both O
the O
reduced O
incidence O
among O
ever-users O
and O
the O
trend O
of O
decreasing O
risk O
with O
increasing O
duration O
of O
use O
are O
consistent O
with O
a O
protective O
effect O
for O
oral O
contraceptives O
in O
these O
women B-species
. O

If O
such O
protection O
exists O
, O
the O
benefits O
of O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
must O
be O
weighed O
against O
its O
possible O
adverse O
effects O
on O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

Although O
there O
are O
data O
to O
suggest O
that O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
small O
increased O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
carriers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
but O
not O
BRCA2 B-gene
) O
mutations O
( O
Narod O
et O
al O
2002 O
) O
, O
this O
effect O
was O
being O
driven O
by O
use O
prior O
to O
the O
mid O
1970s O
. O

A O
more O
recent O
population-based O
study O
has O
found O
no O
evidence O
for O
an O
increased O
risk O
in O
mutation O
carriers O
associated O
with O
use O
of O
current O
formulations O
of O
oral O
contraceptives O
, O
and O
evidence O
that O
current O
formulations O
may O
even O
be O
protective O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
( O
Milne O
et O
al O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
oral O
contraceptive O
use O
in O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
light O
of O
any O
planned O
prophylactic O
surgery O
. O

The O
current O
data O
suggest O
that O
women B-species
with O
intact O
ovaries O
who O
undergo O
prophylactic O
mastectomy O
would O
be O
good O
candidates O
for O
oral O

. O

Further O

are O

In O
the O
last O

several O
reports O
have O
been O
published O
supporting O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
different O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
confer O
different O
cancer-related O
risks O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Gayther O
et O
al O
( O
1995 O
) O
reported O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
relative O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
was O
higher O
in O
families O
with O
mutations O
located O
5 O
' O
to O
exon O

of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
compared O
with O
families O
with O
mutations O
located O
3 O
' O
to O
exon O
13 O
. O

However O
, O
this O
finding O
was O
not O
confirmed O
in O
later O
reports O
. O

Also O
, O
an O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cluster O
region O
( O
OCCR O
) O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
was O
described O
by O
Gayther O
et O
al O
( O
1997 O
) O
. O

A O
later O
international O
collaborative O
study O
provided O
no O
statistically O
significant O
support O
for O
the O
existence O
of O
such O
a O
region O
, O
rather O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
a O
reduced O
absolute O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
for O
OCCR O
mutations O
contributed O
substantially O
to O
the O
effect O
described O
. O

All O
the O
above O
data O
pooled O
different O
but O
neighbouring O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
associated O
them O
with O
phenotypes O
. O

However O
, O
does O
a O
specific O
mutation O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
confer O
different O
phenotypes O
compared O
with O
other O
common O
mutations O
in O
the O
same O
gene O
? O

This O
is O
a O
question O
that O
remains O
unanswered O
especially O
pertaining O
to O
the O
recurrent O
BRCA1 B-gene
exon O
2 O
, O
11 O
and O
13 O
mutations O
. O

The O
answer O
to O
this O
question O
could O
have O
important O
implications O
for O
screening O
, O
genetic O
counselling O
and O
prophylactic O
treatment O
of O
carriers O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
currently O
a O
need O
to O
study O
the O
genotype-phenotype O
correlation O
among O
common O
mutations O
in O

. O

We O
opted O
for O
a O
family-based O
study O
to O
maximise O
the O
number O
of O
individuals O
with O
mutated O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

Although O
this O
approach O
suffers O
from O
bias O
compared O
with O
a O
population-based O
study O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
as O
the O
latter O
approach O
requires O
a O
very O
large O
cohort O
to O
attain O
a O
similar O
number O
of O
individuals O
with O
mutated O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

Therefore O
, O
> O
4000 O
individuals O
in O
a O
population O
are O
required O
to O
be O
tested O
to O
yield O
141 O
individuals O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

The O
extent O
of O
bias O
is O
difficult O
to O
infer O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
accepted O
that O
family-based O
studies O
usually O
overestimate O
the O
lifetime O
risks O
of O
cancer O
because O
the O
presence O
of O
additional O
genetic O
factors O
could O
elevate O
risks O
for O
the O
relatives O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
use O
of O
appropriate O
statistical O
methods O
could O
alleviate O
some O
aspects O
of O
this O
bias O
. O

In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
exhaustively O
searched O
for O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
using O
a O
level O
approach O
that O
involved O
starting O
from O
screening O
for O
known O
founder O
mutations O
up O
to O
sequencing O
all O
exons O
in O
addition O
to O
various O
exon O
rearrangements O
. O

This O
methodology O
would O
increase O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
detecting O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
mutations O
, O
and O
this O
was O
reflected O
in O
our O
high O
pickup O
mutation O
rate O
accounting O
for O
67 O
% O
of O
individuals O
recruited O
in O
this O
study O
. O

A O
total O
of O
56 O
% O
of O
individuals O
harboured O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutated O
gene O
; O
this O
figure O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
one O
previously O
estimated O
for O
the O
UK O
population O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
proportion O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation-bearing O
individuals O
in O
this O
study O
is O
within O
the O
range O
previously O
published O
for O
the O
UK O
. O

It O
is O
well O
accepted O
that O
mutation O
frequencies O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
in O
high-risk O
families O
vary O
widely O
among O
different O
populations O
, O
being O
highest O
in O
Russia O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
in O
Iceland O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
ascertainment O
or O
methodological O
bias O
, O
or O
more O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
reflection O
of O
human B-species
migration O
and O
establishment O
of O
founders O
. O

In O
our O
UK O
East O
Midlands O
series O
, O
three O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
were O
recurrent O
, O
namely O

accounting O
for O
the O
most O
common O

within O
exon O
11 O
( O
found O

, O

The O

lists O
185delAG B-mutation
, O
4184delTCAA B-mutation
and O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation

among O
the O
20 O
most O
frequent O

; O
these O
are O
consistent O
with O
our O
data O
. O

Also O
, O
our O
data O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
has O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
founder O
mutation O
in O
Britain O
, O
and O
English-speaking O
counties O
with O
historical O

to O
Britain O
. O

In O
that O
regard O
, O
50 O
% O
of O
the O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
mutations O
were O
demonstrated O
in O
Britain O
, O
mainly O
Yorkshire O
, O
suggesting O
a O
northern O
British O
origin O
for O
this O
mutation O
( O
the O

group O
) O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
none O
of O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
repeated O
in O
more O
than O
two O
families O
, O
probably O
indicating O
the O
presence O
of O
many O
BRCA2 B-gene
founders O
( O
or O
de O

mutations O
) O
. O

Although O
we O
did O
not O
haplotype O
families O
carrying O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
mutation O
, O
previous O
haplotypes O
from O
Yorkshire O
indicated O
independent O
origins O
of O
the O
mutation O
from O
the O
Jewish O
founders O
. O

Our O
data O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
risk O
of O
cancer O
. O

Both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
significantly O
associated O
with O
development O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
but O
not O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
, O
was O
significantly O
linked O
to O
the O
development O
of O
cancer O
outside O
the O
breast-ovarian O
axis O
. O

This O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
data O
showing O
that O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
are O
rarely O
linked O
to O
cancer O
at O
sites O
other O
than O
breast O
and O
ovary O
, O
while O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
are O
. O

Regarding O
the O
controversial O
issue O
linking O
mutations O
of O
the O
3 O
' O
end O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
to O
lower O
incidence O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
our O
data O
show O
that O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
indeed O
lower O
when O
mutations O
inflict O
the O
3 O
' O
end O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
. O

However O
, O
the O
trend O
was O
insignificant O
and O
a O
larger O
study O
is O
needed O
to O
resolve O
this O
issue O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
intriguing O
finding O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
notion O
that O
different O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
have O
significantly O
different O
effect O
on O
age-dependent O
expressivity O
. O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
different O
age-dependent O
expressivity O
, O
independent O
of O
cancer O
site O
, O
has O
been O
reported O
for O
three O
of O
the O
most O
common O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
, O
namely O
185delAG B-mutation
, O
4184delTCAA B-mutation
and O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
. O

For O
the O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
mutation O
, O
we O
reported O
a O
mean O
age O
of O
cancer O
diagnosis O
at O
41.4 O
years O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
36.99 O
to O
45.78 O
) O
from O
12 O
independent O
families O
. O

Data O
on O
the O
age-dependent O
penetrance/expressivity O
for O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
are O
scarce O
. O

However O
, O
Unger O
et O
al O
reported O
a O
Belgian O
woman B-species
with O
this O
mutation O
who O
developed O
cancer O
at O
age O
34 O
years O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Yap O
et O
al O
reported O
a O
woman B-species
diagnosed O
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
ages O
32 O
and O
41 O
years O
and O
her O
sister O
, O
carrying O
the O
same O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
mutation O
, O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
age O
43 O
years O
. O

For O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
, O
although O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
mutation O
was O
, O
as O
expected O
, O
among O
the O
highest O
, O
we O
report O
significantly O
lower O
cancer O
rates O
in O
carriers O
of O
this O
mutation O
. O

This O
has O
been O
observed O
before O
in O
Iraqi/Iranian O
women B-species
, O
who O
have O
a O
significantly O
lower O
penetrance O
compared O
with O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
woman B-species
carrying O
the O
same O
mutation O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated O
whether O
this O
difference O
in O
penetrance O
could O
be O
due O
to O
other O
genetic O
variation O
such O
as O
different O
haplotypes O
, O
environmental O
or O
cultural O
influences O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
we O
report O
here O
that O
the O
mean O
age O
of O
cancer O
diagnosis O
from O
12 O
separate O
families O
carrying O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
mutation O
was O
55 O
years O
( O
95 O
% O
CI O
49.3 O
to O
60.7 O
) O
, O
which O
is O
a O
significantly O
older O
age O
of O
cancer O
diagnosis O
compared O
with O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
mutation O
. O

In O
a O
recent O
report O
, O
using O
a O
meta-analysis O
of O
pedigree O
data O
from O
498 O
BRCA1 B-gene

carriers O
identified O
through O
population-based O
studies O
of O
women B-species
with O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
authors O
have O
shown O
, O
albeit O
not O
significantly O
, O
that O
cancer O
risk O
by O
age O
50 O
years O
is O
lower O
for O
185delAG B-mutation
than O
5382insC B-mutation
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Our O
data O
are O
consistent O
with O
this O
. O

The O
question O
of O
why O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
mutation O
has O
a O
lower O
cancer-related O
expressivity O
that O
is O
age O
dependent O
compared O
to O
other O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated O
. O

Recently O
, O
however O
, O
Perrin-Vidoz O
et O
al O
, O
reported O
that O
transcripts O
bearing O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
mutation O
are O
not O
subjected O
to O
degradation O
by O
nonsense-mediated O
mRNA O
decay O
. O

This O
important O
observation O
leads O
us O
to O
hypothesise O
that O
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
mutation O
there O
could O
still O
be O
some O
truncated O
, O
but O
functional O
, O
BRCA1 O
protein O
delaying O
the O
onset O
of O
cancer O
. O

In O
support O
of O
this O
, O
Buisson O
et O
al O
have O
demonstrated O
translational O
re-initiation O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
minigenes O
at O
position O
128 O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
premature O
termination O
codon O
at O
position O
36 O
or O
39 O
. O

However O
, O
using O
western O
blotting O
and O
immunoprecipitation O
, O
we O
and O
Buisson O
et O
al O
were O
unable O
to O
detect O
N-terminally O
or O
C-terminally O
truncated O
BRCA1 O
proteins O
from O
lymphocytes O
of O
carriers O
, O
probably O
indicating O
an O
unstable O
nature O
of O
the O
truncated O
BRCA1 O
protein O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
truncated O
BRCA1 O
protein O
could O
still O
be O
functional O
in O
a O
microenvironment O
or O
at O
concentrations O
beyond O
the O
detection O
limit O
of O
current O
technologies O
. O

This O
hypothesis O
remains O
to O
be O
proven O
. O

Obviously O
, O
the O
role O
of O
other O
genetic O
background O
or O
haplotypes O
and O
environmental O
influences O
on O
age-dependent O
expressivity O
can O
not O
be O
underestimated O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
carriers O
of O
exon B-mutation
13 I-mutation
duplication I-mutation
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
have O
other O
genetic O
aberrations O
that O
could O
influence O
expressivity O
. O

Regardless O
of O
the O
mechanism O
, O
our O
findings O
have O
important O
ramifications O
regarding O
the O
design O
of O
future O
studies O
for O
the O
estimation O
of O

and O
more O
specifically O
on O

Moreover O
, O
the O
time O

Assessing O
an O

a O
procedure O
growing O
in O
clinical O
importance O
from O
an O
optional O

to O
a O
powerful O

However O
, O
full O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
screening O
still O
remains O
a O
tedious O
task O
due O
to O
gene O
length O
, O
the O
plethora O
of O
mutations O
, O
the O
high O

requiring O

approach O
, O

in O

This O
procedure O
remains O
too O
expensive O
to O
target O
a O
broader O
population O
part O
and O
can O
not O
be O
routinely O
applied O
in O
less O

Several O
studies O
have O

that O
in O
certain O
countries O
and O

the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O

is O
limited O
to O

, O
a O
fact O
that O
allows O

From O
such O
broader O
studies O
, O
it O
has O
emerged O
that O
many O

to O
carry O
a O
mutation O
do O
not O
have O
a O

As O
our O

involved O
individuals O
with O

, O
our O
aim O
here O
is O

the O

have O

only O
in O

The O
present O
findings O
have O
important O
implications O
for O
determining O
the O
policy O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
testing O
in O
the O
Greek O
population O
and O
populations O
with O
similar O
genetic O
background O
. O

It O
is O
currently O
widely O
accepted O
that O
women B-species
who O
fulfil O
certain O
criteria O
based O
on O
family O
history O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
with O
age O
of O
onset O
should O
be O
directed O
towards O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genetic O
testing O
. O

The O
complexities O
of O
the O
particular O
test O
prohibit O
its O
recommendation O
to O
wider O
targets O
, O
such O
as O
all O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
or O
even O
the O
whole O
population O
. O

However O
, O
many O
mutation O
carriers O
who O
do O
not O
fulfil O
screening O
criteria O
have O
been O
identified O
before O
. O

We O
have O
discovered O
among O
our O
cohort O
six O
mutation O
carriers O
with O
no O
reported O
family O
history O
and O
with O
later O
onset O
of O
the O
disease O
( O
Table O
2 O
) O
. O

These O
cases O
would O
have O
been O
missed O
if O
commonly O
applied O
( O
e.g O
. O
two O
cases O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
before O
age O
50 O
) O
screening O
criteria O
were O
used O
. O

As O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
are O
highly O
penetrant O
and O
de O
novo O
formation O
is O
extremely O
rare O
, O
the O
following O
factors O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
an O
explanation O
and O
taken O
into O
account O
when O
evaluating O
patients B-species
for O
referral O
to O
genetic O
testing O
: O
misreported O
family O
history O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
or O
unwillingness O
to O
share O
information O
, O
limited O
family O
structure O
, O
greater O
prevalence O
of O
male O
family O
members O
, O
paternal O
inheritance O
, O
also O
for O
Greece O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
National O
Cancer O
Registry O
. O

To O
address O
this O
matter O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
simplified O
BRCA1 B-gene
screening O
for O
the O
four O
most O
prevalent O
Greek O
mutations O
designed O
and O
employed O
here O
should O
be O
offered O
to O
more O
women B-species
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
especially O
those O
with O
an O
early O
disease O
onset O
and O
ideally O
to O
all O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
propose O
that O
all O
early-onset O
patients B-species
should O
be O
directed O
towards O
full O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
screening O
as O
the O
true O
frequency O
of O
mutations O
in O
this O
group O
as O
indicated O
by O
our O
results O
could O
be O
close O
to O
20 O
% O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
2.6 O
% O
of O
the O
Greek O
patients B-species
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
independently O
of O
age O
or O
family O
history O
and O
10 O
% O
of O
Greek O
patients B-species
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
before O
age O
40 O
carry O
one O
of O
four O
common O
Greek O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

This O
finding O
shows O
the O
necessity O
of O
a O
new O
simplified O
and O
focused O
genetic O
screening O
approach O
reaching O
to O
a O
wider O
population O
target O
. O

Our O
results O
also O
imply O
that O
recommendation O
of O
full O
screening O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
, O
and O
even O
additional O
predisposing O

, O
to O
all O

should O
remain O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
as O
new O
technologies O
emerge O
that O
can O
lower O
the O
cost O
and O

involved O
. O

This O
point O
gains O
additional O
weight O
under O
the O
view O
of O

( O

and O

which O
were O

in O
the O

. O

Tissue O
samples O
were O
taken O
at O
various O
time O
points O
thereafter O
for O
assessment O
of O
proliferative O
activity O
and O
expression O
of O
oestrogen O
and O
progesterone O
receptors O
( O
ERalpha O
and O
PgR O
) O
by O

. O

Oestradiol O
increased O
proliferation O
in O
the O
breast O
epithelium O
from O
women B-species
carrying O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
genes O
, O
those O
otherwise O
at O
increased O
risk O
and O
those O
at O
population O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
increase O
was O
reduced O
by O
both O
TAM O
and O
FUL O
in O
all O
risk O
groups O
. O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
E2 O
, O
PgR O
expression O
was O
reduced O
in O
all O
risk O
groups O
but O
significantly O
more O
so O
in O
the O
BRCA-mutated O
groups O
. O

Subsequent O
E2 O
treatment O
caused O
a O
rapid O
, O
complete O
induction O
of O
PgR O
expression O
in O
the O
population-risk O
group O
but O
not O
in O
the O
high-risk O
or O
BRCA-mutated O
groups O
in O
which O
PgR O
induction O
was O
significantly O
delayed O
. O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
E2 O
induces O
breast O
epithelial O
PgR O
expression O
are O
impaired O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
whereas O
those O
regulating O
proliferation O
remain O
intact O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
early O
anti-oestrogen O
treatment O
should O
prevent O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
very O
high-risk O
women B-species
. O

Approximately O
5 O
% O
of O
all O
cases O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
associated O
with O
inherited O
predisposition O
syndromes O
and O
about O
half O
of O
these O
are O
attributable O
to O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
( O
Hopper O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

Carriers O
of O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
have O
up O
to O
a O
90 O
% O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
Rebbeck O
, O
2002 O
) O
and O
effective O
preventative O
strategies O
are O
required O
for O
these O
women B-species
. O

A O
number O
of O
trials O
have O
now O
shown O
that O
endocrine O
agents O
such O
as O
tamoxifen O
( O
TAM O
) O
or O
raloxifene O
can O
prevent O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
women B-species
at O
increased O
risk O
of O
the O
disease O
( O
Cuzick O
et O
al O
, O
2003 O
) O
. O

The O
question O
arises O
as O
to O
whether O
agents O
such O
as O
these O
can O
be O
used O
for O
prevention O
specifically O
in O
women B-species
bearing O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

The O
prevalence O
of O

the O

in O
the O
NSABP O
P1 O
trial O
was O
unknown O
( O

) O
and O
therefore O
no O
conclusion O
regarding O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
TAM O
in O
mutation O
carriers O
can O
be O
made O
from O
this O
study O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
endocrine O
agents O
such O
as O
TAM O
will O
not O
be O
effective O
in O
preventing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
tumours O
( O
up O
to O
80 O
% O
) O
arising O
in O
these O
women B-species
are O
oestrogen O
receptor O
alpha O

ERalpha O
) O
negative O
, O
have O
a O
high O

and O
are O

grade O
( O

) O
. O

All O
these O
features O
are O
associated O
with O
resistance O
to O

therapy O
and O
it O
is O
clear O
from O
the O

reduce O
the O
incidence O
of O
ERalpha-positive O
but O
not O
-negative O
tumours O
( O
Cuzick O
et O
al O
, O
2003 O
) O
. O

Against O
these O
, O
however O
, O
are O
data O
showing O
that O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
is O
altered O
by O
endocrine O
risk O
modifiers O
such O
as O
pregnancy O
( O
Rebbeck O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
becoming O
clear O
that O
prophylactic O
oophorectomy O
not O
only O
reduces O
the O
incidence O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
mutation O
carriers O
but O
also O
that O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
Rebbeck O
et O
al O
, O
2002 O
) O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
both O
oophorectomy O
and O
adjuvant O
TAM O
treatment O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
contralateral O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
mutation O
carriers O
( O
Narod O
et O
al O
, O
2000 O
; O
Metcalfe O
et O
al O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O

This O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
initial O
stages O
of O
tumour O
formation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
are O
hormone O
dependent O
, O
in O
which O
case O
early O
endocrine O
therapy O
might O
be O
an O
effective O
prevention O
strategy O
. O

This O
possibility O
is O
not O
addressed O
by O
existing O
trials O
such O
as O
the O
one O
run O
by O
the O
NSABP O
because O
the O
effects O
of O
TAM O
became O
evident O
after O
a O
relatively O
short O
follow-up O
period O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
anti-oestrogen O
was O
preventing O
progression O
of O
existing O
subclinical O
lesions O
rather O
than O
inhibiting O
de O
novo O
tumorigenesis O
( O
Fisher O
et O
al O
, O
1998 O
) O
. O

Significant O
advances O
have O
been O
made O
towards O
understanding O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
act O
. O

The O
products O
of O
both O
genes O
are O
large O
, O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
proteins O
that O
have O
fundamental O
roles O
in O
protecting O
and O
repairing O
the O
genome O
( O

and O
Scott O

2000 O
; O
Kerr O
and O
Ashworth O
, O
2001 O
; O
Venkitaraman O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

The O
prevailing O
view O
on O
the O
mechanism O
by O
which O
heterozygous O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
predispose O
to O
cancer O
is O
that O
they O
provide O
an O
unstable O
genetic O
environment O
in O
which O
further O
mutations O
leading O
to O
tumorigenesis O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
occur O
( O
Deng O
and O
Scott O
, O
2000 O
) O
. O

However O
, O
this O
does O
not O
explain O
why O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
predispose O
so O
specifically O
to O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
nor O
why O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
insufficiency O
can O
have O
profound O
effects O
on O
processes O
such O
as O
proliferation O
and O
differentiation O
. O

For O
example O
, O
global O
deletion O
of O
either O
gene O
in O
mice B-species
leads O
to O
embryonic O
lethality O
due O
to O
defects O
in O
proliferation O
and/or O
differentiation O
as O
well O
as O
genetic O
instability O
( O

and O

Conditional O
mutation O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
in O
the O

results O
in O

formation O
and O

( O
Xu O
et O
al O
, O
1999 O
; O
Brown O
et O
al O
, O

) O
. O

Both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
expressed O
in O
tissues O
undergoing O
rapid O
proliferation O
prior O
to O
undergoing O
terminal O
differentiation O
including O
the O
pregnant O
mammary O
gland O
( O
Chodosh O
, O
1998 O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O

studies O
indicate O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
in O
particular O
, O
interacts O
with O
and O
represses O
both O
nuclear O
and O
nongenomic O
ERalpha O

) O
. O

These O
data O
raise O
the O
possibility O
that O
proliferation O
and O
expression O
of O
oestrogen-regulated O
genes O
are O
altered O
in O
oestrogen O
target O
tissues O
such O
as O
the O

. O

The O
aims O
of O
the O
present O
study O
were O
two-fold O
: O
first O
, O
to O
determine O
whether O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
haploinsufficiency O
altered O
the O
oestrogen O
sensitivity O
of O
normal O
breast O
epithelium O
in O
terms O
of O
proliferation O
and O
induction O
of O
oestrogen-induced O
genes O
. O

The O
second O
aim O
was O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
tamoxifen O
, O
a O
selective O
oestrogen O
receptor O
modulator O
( O
SERM O
) O
and O
fulvestrant O
, O
an O
anti-oestrogen O
devoid O
of O
agonist O
activity O
, O
were O
able O
to O
abrogate O
the O
proliferative O
effects O
of O
E2 O
on O
normal O
breast O
tissue O
from O
women B-species
carrying O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
or O
who O
were O
, O
otherwise O
, O
at O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

To O
do O
this O
, O
we O
used O
a O
model O
of O
normal O
human B-species
breast O
tissue O
implanted O
into O
athymic O
nude O
mice B-species
where O
it O
was O
treated O
with O
oestradiol O
( O
E2 O
) O
and/or O
anti-oestrogens O
. O

We O
show O
that O
epithelial O
proliferation O
in O
breast O
tissue O
from O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
or O
who O
are O
otherwise O
at O
high O
risk O
is O
stimulated O
by O
oestradiol O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
to O
that O
in O
tissue O
taken O
from O
women B-species
at O
population O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
effects O
of O
E2 O
on O
proliferation O
could O
be O
reduced O
by O
the O
addition O
of O
TAM O
or O
fulvestrant O
in O
all O
three O
risk O
groups O
. O

However O
, O
induction O
of O
progesterone O
receptor O
expression O
by O
E2 O
was O
impaired O
in O
the O
tissue O
taken O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
compared O
to O
that O
taken O
from O

DISCUSSION O
The O
effects O
of O
heterozygous O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
breast B-disease
cancer-predisposing O
genes O
on O
the O
endocrine O
sensitivity O
of O
human B-species
breast O
epithelial O
cells O
are O
unknown O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
determine O
what O
these O
effects O
may O
be O
because O
of O
the O
increasing O
use O
of O
endocrine O
agents O
such O
as O
TAM O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
prevention O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Although O
the O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
play O
critical O
roles O
in O
DNA O
damage O
repair O
( O
Brodie O
and O
Deng O
, O
2001 O
; O
Deng O
and O
Brodie O
, O
2001 O
; O
Kerr O
and O
Ashworth O
, O
2001 O
) O
, O
in O
vitro O
studies O
suggest O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
product O
can O
also O
interact O
with O
and O
suppress O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
ERalpha O
( O
Fan O
et O
al O
, O
1999 O
; O
Fan O
et O
al O
, O

) O
. O

As O
E2 O
is O
the O
major O
steroid O
mitogen O
for O
the O
human B-species
breast O
epithelium O
acting O
via O
the O
ERalpha O
, O
it O
might O
be O
predicted O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
, O
possibly O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
haploinsufficiency O
would O
result O
in O
an O
enhanced O
proliferative O
response O
to O
E2 O
. O

The O
present O
data O
show O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
as O
proliferation O
of O
breast O
epithelium O
from O
mutation O
carriers O
in O
response O
to O
E2 O
treatment O
does O
not O
differ O
significantly O
from O
that O
of O
tissue O
from O
women B-species
at O
population O
risk O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
might O
be O
predicted O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
haploinsufficiency O
would O
confer O
anti-oestrogen O
resistance O
to O
the O
breast O
epithelium O
. O

Again O
, O
we O
show O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
as O
both O
the O
SERM O
TAM O
and O
the O
specific O
anti-oestrogen O
fulvestrant O
could O
reverse O
the O
effects O
of O
E2 O
on O
proliferation O
. O

Both O
anti-oestrogens O
also O
reversed O
the O
proliferative O
effects O
of O
E2 O
in O
tissue O
from O
women B-species
at O
high O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
because O
of O
their O
family O
history O
. O

These O
findings O
lead O
us O
to O
suggest O
that O
early O
intervention O
to O
antagonise O
the O
effects O
of O
E2 O
or O
reduce O
serum O
E2 O
levels O
would O
be O
effective O
for O
the O
prevention O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

As O
both O
the O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
are O
involved O
in O
postreplicative O
DNA O
repair O
( O

of O
the O

the O

. O

The O

might O
also O
be O

. O

Although O
there O
are O
no O

in O
the O

of O
the O

reports O
of O
an O

by O
Mote O

( O

) O
. O

The O
delayed O
PgR O
response O
to O
E2 O
in O
the O
mutation O
carriers O
is O
paradoxical O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
in O
vitro O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
product O
is O
a O
repressor O
of O
both O
nuclear O
and O
nongenomic O
mechanisms O
of O
ERalpha O
action O
( O
Fan O

, O

, O

; O
Razandi O
et O
al O
, O

) O
. O

However O
, O
some O
of O
these O
experiments O
used O
reporter O
constructs O
containing O
a O
consensus O
oestrogen O
response O
element O
( O
ERE O
) O
from O
the O
vitellogenin O
gene O
to O
examine O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
BRCA1 O
protein O
on O
ERalpha O
transcriptional O
activity O
( O
Fan O
et O
al O
, O
1999 O
) O
, O
whereas O
others O
have O
shown O
that O
overexpression O
of O
BRCA1 O
abrogates O
the O
effects O
of O
E2 O
on O
expression O
of O
the O
oestrogen-induced O
genes O
, O
pS2 O
and O
cathepsin O
D O
( O
Fan O
et O

, O

) O
. O

The O
PgR B-gene
gene O
promoter O
does O
not O
contain O
a O
complete O
ERE O
but O
it O
does O
have O
ERE O
half O
sites O
adjacent O
to O
those O
for O
Sp-1 O
( O
Petz O
and O
Nardulli O
, O
2000 O
) O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
BRCA1 O
protein O
has O
significantly O
different O
effects O
at O
this O
site O
in O
human B-species
breast O
epithelium O
in O
vivo O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
the O
differences O
in O
expression O
of O
PgR O
in O
response O
to O
E2 O
treatment O
may O
result O
from O
an O
alteration O
in O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
A O
and O
B O
isoforms O
of O
the O
PR O
. O

Many O
commercially O
available O
antibodies O
used O
for O
PgR O
IHC O
fail O
to O
detect O
the O
B O
form O
of O
the O
receptor O
in O
formalin-fixed O
, O
paraffin-embedded O
tissues O
( O
Mote O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

The O
specificity O
of O
the O
antibody O
used O
in O
the O
present O
study O
is O
not O
known O
at O
present O
, O
but O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
it O
also O
does O
not O
detect O
PgRB O
in O
routinely O
processed O
tissue O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
apparent O
alteration O
in O
PgR O
induction O
following O
E2 O
treatment O
of O
tissue O
from O
women B-species
with O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
may O
reflect O
an O
alteration O
in O
the O
PgRA O
to O
PgRB O
ratio O
such O
that O
PgRB O
expression O
is O
increased O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
PgRA O
. O

One O
way O
of O
confirming O
this O
would O
be O
to O
use O
more O
specific O
antibodies O
to O
determine O
the O
ratios O
of O
the O
two O
PgR O
isoforms O
in O
the O
breast O
epithelium O
from O
the O
mutation O
carriers O
compared O
to O
those O
from O
subjects O
at O
population O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
approach O
has O
been O
used O
by O
Mote O
et O
al O
( O
2004 O
) O
who O
have O
shown O
that O
not O
only O
is O
the O
ratio O
of O
PgRA O
to O
PgRB O
altered O
in O
favour O
of O
PgRA O
in O
normal O
breast O
tissue O
taken O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
but O
also O
that O
expression O
of O
both O
isoforms O
is O
markedly O
reduced O
compared O
to O
tissue O
from O
normal-risk O
women B-species
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
reduced O
levels O
of O
PgR O
expression O
seen O
in O
the O
mutation O
carriers O
in O
the O
present O
study O
is O
due O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
both O
PgR O
isoforms O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
luminal O
epithelial O
cells O
that O
proliferate O
in O
response O
to O
E2 O
do O
not O
contain O
the O
ERalpha O
, O
whereas O
PgR O
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
ERalpha-positive O
cells O
( O
Clarke O
et O
al O
, O
1997b O
) O
. O

Clearly O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
would O
act O
as O
a O
coregulator O
of O
ERalpha O
activity O
only O
in O
cells O
that O
contain O
the O
receptor O
; O
therefore O
, O
we O
might O
expect O
BRCA1 B-gene
to O
be O
involved O
directly O
in O
the O
control O
of O
PgR O
expression O
but O
not O
proliferation O
and O
this O
is O
supported O
by O
the O
present O
data O
. O

It O
will O
be O
important O
to O
determine O
exactly O
how O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
products O
contribute O
to O
the O
control O
of O
PgR O
expression O
in O
the O
human B-species
breast O
epithelium O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
E2 O
on O
PgR O
expression O
in O
tissue O
from O
the O
high-risk O
group O
of O
women B-species
also O
appeared O
to O
be O
altered O
although O
the O
differences O
between O
this O
group O
and O
the O
population O
risk O
group O
just O
failed O
to O
reach O
significance O
. O

This O
may O
reflect O
the O
fact O
that O
many O
of O
the O
women B-species
in O
this O
risk O
group O
were O
given O
a O
probability O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
of O
at O
least O
one O
in O
four O
based O
on O
their O
family O
history O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
one O
in O
four O
of O
these O
women B-species
could O
be O
carrying O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
whereas O
the O
others O
will O
be O
at O
population O
risk O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

This O
would O
dilute O
the O
alteration O
in O
the O
effects O
of O
E2 O
on O
PgR O
expression O
associated O
with O
BRCA B-gene
gene O
mutations O
in O
this O
group O
. O

A O
potential O
criticism O
of O
our O
line O
of O
thinking O
could O
be O
that O
there O
is O
no O
haploinsufficient O
effect O
of O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
, O
and O
that O
anti-oestrogen O
treatment O
functions O
only O
as O
a O
secondary O
preventer O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Given O
that O
primary O
prevention O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
would O
have O
to O
take O
place O
at O
least O
6 O
and O
possibly O
10 O
years O
prior O
to O
a O
clinically O
apparent O
breast B-disease
tumour I-disease
being O
detected O
, O
none O
of O
the O
prevention O
trials O
and O
particularly O
not O
the O
NSABP O
trial O
( O
King O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
would O
have O
been O
powered O
to O
detect O
a O
primary O
preventive O
role O
. O

There O
is O
nonetheless O
evidence O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
that O
TAM O
may O
be O
effective O
in O
long-term O
prevention O
of O
second O
primary O
cancers O
and O
part O
of O
this O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
due O
to O
a O
primary O
preventive O
role O
. O

This O
is O
because O
the O
level O
of O
reduction O
seen O
would O
not O
be O
consistent O
with O
secondary O
prevention O
of O
what O
are O
mostly O
ER-negative O
tumours O
( O
Narod O
et O
al O
, O
2000 O
; O
Metcalfe O
et O
al O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O

That O
primary O
prevention O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
occurs O
by O
reducing O
oestrogen O
stimulation O
of O
the O
breast O
is O
now O
beyond O
dispute O
. O

Oophorectomy O
prior O
to O
the O
menopause O
substantially O
reduces O
the O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
Rebbeck O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
, O
2002 O
) O
. O

Even O
though O
BRCA1 B-gene
cancers O
are O
thought O
to O
derive O
from O
basal O
cells O
that O
are O
ER O
negative O
, O
these O
cells O
are O
still O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
neighbouring O
ER-positive O
epithelial O
cells O
. O

Reducing O
the O
growth-inducing O
signals O
of O
these O
cells O
will O
potentially O
reduce O
proliferation O
of O
the O
basal O
cells O
and O
reduce O
the O
chances O
of O
introducing O
mutations O
during O
cell O
division O
by O
naturally O
occurring O
replication O
error O
. O

Even O
if O
there O
is O
no O
heterozygous O
effect O
on O
the O
cell O
of O
carrying O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
, O
anti-oestrogen O
treatment O
is O
still O
likely O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
primary O
prevention O
by O
this O
mechanism O
. O

Yet O
, O
there O
may O
well O
be O
a O
haploinsufficient O
effect O
. O

We O
have O
shown O
that O
there O
does O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
difference O
between O
BRCA1-mutated O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
controls O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Kote-Jarai O
et O
al O
( O
2004 O
) O
have O
shown O
that O
fibroblasts O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
can O
be O
distinguished O
from O
controls O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
response O
to O
radiation O
damage O
in O
microarray O
analysis O
. O

The O
elusive O
haploinsufficient O
effect O
and O
a O
functional O
assay O
for O
the O
heterozygous O
state O
may O
not O
be O
too O
far O
away O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
E2-stimulated O
proliferation O
in O
breast O
epithelium O
taken O
from O
women B-species
bearing O
heterozygous O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
can O
be O
reversed O
by O
both O
a O
SERM O
( O
TAM O
) O
and O
an O
anti-oestrogen O
( O
fulvestrant O
) O
that O
is O
without O
agonist O
effects O
. O

We O
have O
also O
shown O
that O
altered O
expression O
of O
PgR O
is O
a O
phenotype O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
early O
anti-oestrogen O
treatment O
should O
be O
effective O
for O
the O
prevention O
of O
breast B-disease

women B-species

with O

the O
ages O

in O

age O
groups O
, O
these O
age O
differences O
were O
not O
reflected O
in O
the O

Previous O

reported O
no O
differences O
in O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
between O
black O
and O

However O
, O
several O
reports O
have O
shown O
differences O
in O
uptake O
of O
genetic O
testing O
between O
the O
two O
groups O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
that O
black O

less O

prior O
to O
our O
study O
than O
white O
women B-species
( O
p O

) O
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
if O
this O
result O
is O
because O
few O
black O
women B-species
agreed O
to O
genetic O
testing O
when O
presented O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting O
, O
or O
if O
they O
were O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
offered O
genetic O

by O
their O

. O

Our O
sample O
include O
very O
few O
black O
women B-species
, O
and O
future O
research O
is O
needed O
in O
this O
area O
. O

It O
is O
interesting O
that O
all O
of O
the O
women B-species
in O
this O
study O
agreed O
to O
undergo O
genetic O
testing O
when O
it O
was O
presented O
to O
them O
in O
the O
research O
setting O
and O
almost O
all O
wished O
to O
know O
the O
result O
. O

In O
total O
, O
41 O
women B-species
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

Of O
these O
women B-species
, O
24 O
( O
58.5 O
% O
) O
had O
undergone O
clinical O
genetic O
testing O
at O
the O
time O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
or O
treatment O
. O

These O
24 O
women B-species
were O
in O
a O
group O
of O
80 O
women B-species
who O
had O
undergone O
genetic O
testing O
prior O
to O
our O
study O
. O

The O
proportion O
of O
women B-species
with O
a O
positive O
test O
is O
high O
( O
30 O
% O
) O
; O
this O
reflects O
efficiency O
from O
a O
laboratory O
perspective O
, O
but O
also O
implies O
that O
the O
referring O
physicians O
are O
being O
stringent O
in O
the O
referral O
patterns O
. O

Of O
the O
336 O
women B-species
who O
had O
not O
undergone O
clinical O
testing O
, O
17 O
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
mutation O
. O

This O
is O
a O
low O
rate O
of O
positivity O
( O
5 O
% O
) O
, O
but O
also O
implies O
that O
an O
appreciable O
fraction O
of O
the O
women B-species
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
not O
offered O
or O
had O
not O
availed O
themselves O
of O
testing O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
no O
other O
study O
has O
reported O
on O
the O
frequency O
of O
genetic O
testing O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
a O
population-based O
sample O
of O
women B-species
with O
newly O
diagnosed O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
where O
testing O
is O
freely O
available O
. O

Previous O
research O
on O
uptake O
of O
genetic O
testing O
has O
been O
done O
on O
individuals O
with O
a O
family O
history O
of O
cancer O
, O
including O
those O
from O
families O
with O
known O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
and O
on O
individuals O
attending O
high-risk O
cancer O
clinics O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
there O
is O
no O
family O
history O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
93 O
% O
in O
our O
study O
) O
or O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
83 O
% O
in O
our O
study O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
genetic O
testing O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
might O
not O
be O
recommended O
for O
these O
patients B-species
. O

However O
, O
Risch O
et O
al O
. O
reported O
among O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
37 O
% O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
had O
no O
family O
history O
. O

Thus O
, O
omission O
of O
referral O
for O
genetic O
testing O
for O
such O
women B-species
will O
miss O
more O
than O
one-third O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

There O
are O
limitations O
to O
our O
study O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
some O
women B-species
were O
offered O
genetic O
testing O
at O
the O
time O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
but O
refused O
. O

However O
, O
all O
of O
these O
women B-species
consented O
to O
take O
part O
in O
this O
study O
in O
which O
genetic O
testing O
was O
done O
, O
therefore O
, O
it O
seems O
unlikely O
that O
many O
women B-species
initially O
refused O
genetic O
testing O
and O
then O
elected O
for O
testing O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
study O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
more O
than O
300 O
potentially O
eligible O
women B-species
were O
excluded O
because O
they O
had O
died O
prior O
to O
contact O
with O
our O
research O
personnel O
. O

It O
is O
unknown O
what O
proportion O
of O
these O
women B-species
had O
undergone O
genetic O
testing O
prior O
to O
death O
. O

It O
is O
also O
unclear O
from O
our O
analyses O
if O
practice O
changed O
after O
2001 O
as O
we O
did O
not O
compare O

In O
conclusion O

this O
study O
suggests O
that O
the O
women B-species

BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
adequately O
identified O
and O
offered O
genetic O
testing O
in O
Ontario O
. O

However O
, O
if O
testing O
was O
restricted O
to O
those O
referred O
by O
physicians O
because O
of O
a O
high O
risk O
of O
carrying O
a O
mutation O
, O
approximately O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
mutations O
would O
remain O
unidentified O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
reliance O
on O
physicians O
for O
patient B-species
referrals O
for O
genetic O
testing O
is O
inadequate O
and O
that O
greater O
physician O
education O
and O
public O
awareness O
is O
needed O
. O

The O
medical O
community O
should O
seek O
to O
make O
women B-species
aware O
that O
genetic O
testing O
may O
be O
indicated O
for O
all O
women B-species
with O
invasive O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

That O
is O
not O
to O
say O
that O
they O
should O
seek O
testing O
directly O
from O
the O
laboratory O
, O
but O
that O
they O
should O
bring O
this O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
their O
physicians O
and O
should O
request O
referrals O
to O
genetic O

In O
addition O
, O
future O
consideration O
should O
be O
given O

DISCUSSION O
Our O
results O
do O
not O
show O
a O
major O
effect O
of O
the O
null O
genotypes O
of O
the O
GSTM1 B-gene
and O
GSTT1 B-gene
on O
BC B-disease
risk O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
the O
GSTP1-Val/Val O
allele O
was O
associated O
with O
approximately O
twofold O
BC B-disease
risk O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

In O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
a O
significant O
HR O
of O
3.2 O
was O
found O
in O
homozgotes O
for O
the O
Val O
allele O
, O
whereas O
the O
effect O
among O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
was O
non-significant O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
this O
is O
the O
first O
report O
of O
an O
effect O
of O
GST O
polymorphism O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

A O
major O
limitation O
of O
our O
study O
is O
the O
survival O
bias O
due O
to O
inclusion O
of O
individuals O
while O
alive O
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
consideration O
also O
regarding O
previous O
genetic O
risk O
modifiers O
reported O
among O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
since O
the O
effect O
of O
these O
modifiers O
on O
survival O
is O
unknown O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
the O
GST-Val O
allele O
on O
BC B-disease
prognosis O
contradicted O
in O
previous O
studies O
( O
Goode O
et O
al O
, O
2002 O
; O
Yang O
et O
al O
, O
2005 O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
larger O
studies O
based O
on O
incident O
cases O
are O
warranted O
. O

The O
GSTP1 B-gene
isoenzyme O
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
the O
mammary O
epithelium O
, O
both O
in O
normal O
and O
in O
tumor O
cells O
( O
Forrester O
et O
al O
, O
1990 O
; O
Kelley O
et O
al O
, O
1994 O
) O
. O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
methylation O
of O
the O
promoter O
( O
Arai O
et O
al O
, O
2006 O
) O
and O
low O
expression O
of O
the O
GSTP1 B-gene
gene O
is O
associated O
with O
poor O
prognosis O
in O
BC B-disease
patients B-species
treated O
with O
chemotherapy O
( O
Arai O
et O

, O

) O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
its O
role O
in O
detoxifying O
electrophilic O
molecules O
from O
exogenous O
exposures O
, O
the O
GSTP1 B-gene
gene O
has O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
estradiol O
derivatives O
( O
Cavalieri O
et O

It O
reduces O
the O
concentration O
of O
oestrogen O
quinones O
, O
thereby O
reducing O
the O
potential O
of O
these O
oxidative O
oestrogen O
metabolites O
to O
induce O
DNA O
damage O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
in O
cells O
, O
which O
are O
deficient O
in O
functional O
BRCA1 O
or O
BRCA2 O
, O
key O
proteins O
in O
DNA-damage O
repair O
, O
the O
DNA O
will O
be O
vulnerable O
to O
oxidative O
damage O
. O

The O
role O
of O
the O
BRCA2 O
protein O
in O
DNA O
double-strand O
break O
( O
DSB O
) O
repair O
is O
well O
established O
( O
Boulton O
, O
2006 O
) O
. O

The O
BRCA2 O
protein O
has O
a O
distal O
role O
in O
the O
DNA-repair O
machinery O
( O
Boulton O
, O
2006 O
) O
. O

It O
forms O
a O
complex O
with O
the O
RAD51 O
protein O
, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
DNA O
repair O
through O
homologous O
recombination O
( O
Davies O
et O
al O
, O
2001 O
) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
direct O
function O
of O
BRCA1 O
in O
DSB O
repair O
is O
less O
clear O
, O
although O
a O
more O
proximal O
role O
in O
sensing O
and O
regulation O
of O
cellular O
response O
to O
DNA O
damage O
has O
been O
suggested O
by O
several O
recent O
papers O
( O
Boulton O
, O
2006 O
) O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
BRCA1 O
upregulates O
the O
expression O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
antioxidant O
response O
, O
including O
GST B-gene
genes O
( O
Bae O
et O
al O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O

In O
accordance O
, O
BRCA1 O
deficiency O
conferred O
sensitivity O
to O
several O
oxidising O
agents O
in O
cell O
lines O
( O
Bae O
et O
al O
, O
2004 O
) O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
effect O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
could O
be O
related O
to O
the O
already O
high O
oxidative O
stress O
in O
cells O
deficient O
in O
the O
BRCA1 O
protein O
; O
the O
addition O
of O
low O
active O
GSTP1 O
does O
not O
significantly O
add O
to O
the O
process O
of O
tumorigenesis O
. O

However O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
low O
level O
of O
active O
GSTP1 O
results O
in O
higher O
DNA O
damage O
properly O
sensed O
by O
BRCA1 O
, O
but O
ineffectively O
corrected O
by O
the O
BRCA2 O
complex O
. O

Several O
modifier O
genes O
were O
reported O
in O
carriers O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

A O
modifying O
effect O
has O
been O
confirmed O
by O
two O
or O
more O

for O
two O
of O
these O
modifiers O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
in O
both O
genes O
, O
the O
effect O
differed O
among O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

A O
rare O
polymorphism O
in O
the O
RAD51 B-gene
gene O
was O
associated O
with O
BC B-disease

in O
BRCA2 B-gene

Two O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
these O

included O
heterogeneous O

we O
report O

Introduction O
Ovarian O

ovarian B-disease

America O
. O
5-10 O
% O
of O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease

involves O
strong O
family O

Thus O
, O
the O
familial O
component O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
and O
best-defined O
risk O
factors O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

A O
woman B-species

lifetime O
risk O
for O
ovarian B-disease

is O
1.4 O

is O
estimated O
to O
be O
15-60 O
% O
for O

those O
who O

, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
increased O
risk O
has O
a O
genetic O
component O

A O

to O
those O

The O

of O
BRCA1 B-gene

OSE O
is O
a O

mesothelium O
that O
overlies O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
ovary O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
adult O
OSE O
and O
the O
Mullerian O
epithelia O
arise O
from O
a O
common O
embryonic O
origin O
, O
the O
celomic O

The O

this O

ovarian O
surface O
epithelium O
( O
OSE O
) O
is O
normally O
separated O
from O
the O
ovarian O
stroma O
by O
the O
tunica O
albuginea O
, O
and O
the O
entrapment O
of O
the O
OSE O
cells O
within O
the O
stroma O
to O
form O
inclusion O

generates O
a O
microenvironment O
in O
which O
the O
OSE O
is O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O
paracrine O
influence O
of O
adjacent O
ovarian O
cortical O
stroma O
. O

Such O
epithelial-stromal O
interaction O
is O
important O
for O
epithelial O
differentiation O
, O
and O
may O
account O
for O
the O
Mullerian O
metaplasia O
commonly O
seen O
in O
the O
inclusion O

. O

This O
hypothesis O
is O
supported O
by O
the O
observation O
that O
tubal O
epithelial O
metaplasia O
was O
frequently O
present O
in O
inclusion O
cysts O
of O
ovaries O
contralateral O
to O
ovaries O
containing O
unilateral O
carcinomas O
compared O
to O

It O
has O
been O
postulated O
that O
metaplastic O

dysplastic O
changes O
of O

could O
also O
be O
promoted O
by O
increased O
levels O

In O

that O
OSE O

of O

ovarian I-disease

differs O
not O

Two O
of O
the O
more O
important O
indications O
to O
suggest O
an O

an O

in O

normal O
OSE O
cells O
from O

cancer I-disease
( O
FH-OSE O
) O
is O
the O
enhanced O
expression O
of O
CA125 O
and O
E-cadherin O
. O

CA125 O
and O
E-cadherin O
are O
epithelial O
differentiation O
markers O
, O
which O
have O
little O
if O
any O
expression O
in O

but O
are O
prominent O
in O

epithelial-lined O
clefts O
and O

cysts O
, O
Mullerian O
epithelia O
, O
for O
example O
oviductal B-disease
and I-disease
endometrial I-disease
epithelia I-disease
, I-disease
and I-disease
in I-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
. O

The O
high O
intensity O
and O
number O
of O
cells O
expressing O
both O
markers O
also O
relate O
to O
the O
embryonic O
proximity O
of O
OSE O
to O
Mullerian O
duct O
epithelia O
. O

The O
malignant O
tumors O
often O
have O
histologic O
features O
that O
are O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
architecture O
and O
function O
of O
epithelia O
of O
the O
oviduct O
, O
endometrium O
and O
endocerix O
. O

It O
is O
interesting O
that O
the O
distributions O
of O
E-cadherin O
and O
CA125 O
in O
culture O
were O
similar O
, O
although O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
functions O
of O
these O
two O
cellular O
components O
are O
related O
. O

While O
the O
presence O
of O
hormone O
and O
growth O
factor O
receptors O
of O
OSE O
and O
their O
ability O
to O
secrete O
cytokines O
and O
growth O
factors O
is O
an O
integral O
part O
in O
normal O
OSE O
physiology O
, O
the O
cells O
appear O
to O
become O
less O
responsive O
to O
environmental O
signals O
and O
engaged O
into O
dysregulated O
autocrine O
loops O
with O
malignant O
progression O
. O

For O
example O
, O
macrophage-colony O
stimulating O
factor O
( O
M-CSF O
) O
is O
secreted O
by O
normal O
OSE O
cells O
and O
acts O
in O
a O
paracrine O
manner O
but O
become O
an O
autocrine O
regulatory O
factor O
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cells O
, O
which O
also O
express O
its O
receptor O
. O

Importantly O
, O
FH-OSE O
cells O
produce O
hepatocyte O
growth O
factor O
( O
HGF O
) O
which O
acts O
as O
an O
autocrine O
growth O
regulator O
in O
other O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
cell O
lines O
, O
but O
rarely O
by O
normal O
OSE O
( O
9 O
% O
) O
. O
61 O
% O
of O
FH-OSE O
cultures O
express O
HGF O
and O
Met O
receptor O
concomitantly O
. O

Several O
signaling O
molecules O
, O
including O
those O
of O
the O
phosphoinositol-3-kinase O
pathway O
are O
already O
activated O
in O
FH-OSE O
cultures O
independent O
of O
exogenous O
growth O
factor O
stimulation O
, O
which O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
autocrine O
HGF-Met O
regulation O
in O
these O
cells O
or O
other O
cytokines O
and O
growth O
factors O
. O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
the O
PI3KCA B-gene
gene O
which O
could O
lead O
to O
increased O
phosphoinositol-3-kinase O
activity O
is O
already O
amplified O
in O
FH-OSE O
cells O
, O
similar O
to O
the O
amplification O
of O
this O
gene O
in O
many O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

Perhaps O
one O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
observations O
in O
these O
studies O
is O
that O
FH-OSE O
has O
a O
more O
limited O
growth O
potential O
and O
tends O
to O
senescence O
earlier O
than O
NFH-OSE O
in O
culture O
. O

This O
appears O
at O
a O
first O
glance O
to O
be O
different O
from O
the O
increased O
cell O
growth O
that O
confers O
tumorigenesis O
, O
but O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
the O
paradoxical O
acquisition O
of O
Mullerian O
epithelial O
differentiation O
in O
early O
stages O
of O
ovarian O
neoplastic O
progression O
. O

As O
discussed O
earlier O
, O
most O
FH-OSE O
cultures O
have O
a O
propensity O
to O
undergo O
metaplasia O
to O
a O
Mullerian O
phenotype O
under O
physiological O
conditions O
, O
however O
routine O
culture O
condition O
does O
not O
support O
expansion O
of O
these O
transformed O
characteristics O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
differentiated O
, O
metaplastic O
surface O
epithelium O
tends O
to O
senescence O
earlier O
in O
culture O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
the O
metaplastic O
phenotype O
may O
be O
reversible O
and O
is O
lost O
in O
culture O
, O
because O
causative O
factors O
, O
present O
in O
vivo O
, O
are O
missing O
. O

A O
shorter O
telomeric O
length O
of O
FH-OSE O
than O
NFH-OSE O
cells O
may O
provide O
an O
alternative O
explanation O
to O
the O
reduced O
growth O
potential O
in O
these O
cells O
. O

Loss O
of O
telomere O
protection O
which O
represents O
a O
greater O
proximity O
to O
cell O
senescence O
and O
a O
decrease O
in O
genomic O
stability O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
earlier O
age O
of O
onset O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
women B-species
with O
familial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
syndromes I-disease
. O

Although O
the O
populations O
chosen O
for O
comparative O
studies O
are O
likely O
to O
represent O
cancer-prone O
and O
non O
cancer-prone O
groups O
have O
some O
limitations O
. O

First O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
accurately O
define O
the O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Women B-species
in O
the O
general O
population O
who O
are O
carriers O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
may O
be O
at O
a O
greater O
risk O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
due O
to O
genetic O
reasons O
, O
however O
this O
does O
not O
account O
for O
other O
known O
non-genetic O
factors O
such O
as O
reproductive O
history O
and O
use O
of O
oral O
contraceptives O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
control O
population O
may O
not O
be O
a O
pure O
low-risk O
population O
, O
since O
in O
most O
studies O
neither O
extensive O
family O
history O
analysis O
nor O
BRCA1 B-gene
testing O
has O
been O
performed O
on O
these O
women B-species
. O

Second O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
statistically O
for O
age O
differences O
between O
the O
high-risk O
cases O
and O
controls O
. O

Because O
familial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
diagnosed O
at O
a O
younger O
age O
than O
sporadic O
ovarian O
cancer O
, O
women B-species
who O
decide O
to O
have O
their O
ovaries O
removed O
prophylactically O
to O
prevent O
the O
development O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
typically O
young O
, O
usually O
before O
age O
45 O
as O
soon O
as O
childbearing O
is O
completed O
. O

Ovaries O
are O
very O
rarely O
removed O
from O
women B-species
at O
this O
young O
age O
under O
any O
other O
circumstances O
. O

BRCA-associated O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
Many O
studies O
have O
sought O
to O
determine O
potential O
serum O
biomarkers O
by O
comparing O
expression O
patterns O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
and O
normal O
human B-species
OSE O
cells O
using O
high-throughput O
genomic O
and O
proteomic O
technologies O
. O

Important O
to O
this O
review O
, O
Jazaeri O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2002 O
) O
used O
microarray O
technology O
to O
examine O
the O
role O
of O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
in O
ovarian O
carcinogenesis O
by O
comparing O
gene O
expression O
patterns O
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
that O
are O
associated O
with O
germline O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
sporadic O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

Interestingly O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2-associated O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
display O
distinct O
gene O
expression O
profiles O
. O
110 O
genes O
showed O
statistically O
significant O
different O
expression O
levels O
. O

This O
result O
suggests O
that O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
have O
different O
functions O
in O
ovarian O
carcinogenesis O
even O
though O
both O
proteins O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
DNA O
damage O
repair O
, O
chromatin O
remodeling O
and O
transcriptional O
regulation O
. O

These O
data O
are O
in O
agreement O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
illustrating O
differences O
in O
gene O
expression O
profiles O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2-linked O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
second O
important O
finding O
is O
that O
the O
molecular O
profiles O
of O
hereditary B-disease
and I-disease
sporadic I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
are O
not O
significantly O
different O
; O
sporadic O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
shared O
gene O
expression O
features O
of O
either O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2-associated O
tumors O
. O

The O
parallels O
in O
hereditary B-disease
and I-disease
sporadic I-disease
ovarian I-disease
tumor I-disease
phenotypes O
suggest O
that O
sporadic O
tumors O
may O
also O
result O
from O
epigenetic O
loss O
of O
BRCA O
functions O
through O
inactivation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

Although O
mutations O
of O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
are O
rare O
in O
sporadic O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
, O
loss O
of O
BRCA O
function O
through O
high O
rates O
of O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
, O
hypermethylation O
of O
the O
BRCA O
promoter O
or O
other O
mechanisms O
is O
a O
frequent O
event O
in O
sporadic O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
. O

These O
alternate O
pathways O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
function O
of O
BRCA1 O
or O
BRCA2 O
which O
is O
required O
for O
the O
disease O
phenotype O
to O
develop O
. O

Consistently O
, O
decreased O
expression O
of O
BRCA1 O
in O
the O
nucleus O
is O
observed O
in O
sporadic O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
, O
suggesting O
defects O
in O
normal O
nuclear O
function O
of O
this O
protein O
. O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
in O
sporadic O
tumors O
are O
altered O
in O
a O
similar O
way O
as O
in O
BRCA-associated O
ovarian B-disease
tumors I-disease
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
there O
are O
other O
overriding O
key O
pathways O
driving O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
which O
are O
as O
yet O
undescribed O
. O

Although O
the O
clinical O
and O
pathological O
features O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
in O
women B-species
with O
inherited O
germline O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
compared O
to O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
that O

less O
consistent O
, O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
arising O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
mutation-positive O
families O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
invasive O

high O
grade O
and O
of O
serous O
histologic O
type O
than O
cancers O
arising O
in O

without O
BRCA B-gene

. O

Is O
the O
relative O
risk O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
associated O
with O
the O
location O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
? O

Although O
there O
is O
little O
evidence O
for O
mutational O
hotspots O
or O
clustering O
on O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
except O
in O
certain O
populations O
, O
e.g O
. O

Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
, O
a O
defined O
repertoire O
of O
mutations O
have O
been O
detected O
, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
location O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
is O
associated O
with O
different O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

Mutations O
at O
the O
C-terminal O
of O
BRCA1 O
protein O
appear O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
whereas O
mutations O
at O
the O
N-terminal O
of O
the O
protein O
are O
more O
strongly O
associated O
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
RING-finger O
domain O
of O
the O
N-terminus O
of O
BRCA1 O
protein O
appears O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
anti-apoptotic O
function O
in O
OSE O
cells O
. O

Among O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
greatest O
for O
women B-species
with O
mutations O
clustered O
in O
a O
region O
of O
3.3 O
kb O
in O
exon O
11 O
. O

However O
, O
other O
genetic O
and O
environmental O
factors O
are O
also O
important O
. O

For O
example O
, O
rare O
alleles O
of O
HRAS1 B-gene
have O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
the O
risk O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
least O
two O
times O
in O
women B-species
with O
the O
same O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
. O

Rare O
HRAS1 B-gene
alleles O
also O
contribute O
to O
a O
greater O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Preliminary O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
17beta-hydroxysteroid O

function O
as O
a O
linked O
modifier O
of O
ovarian B-disease

The O
nature O

The O

one O
mutation O
in O

present O

There O
are O
two O
possible O
hypotheses O

explain O
why O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
lead O
specifically O
to O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
: O
first O
, O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
second O
allele O
of O
BRCA B-gene
preferentially O
occurs O
in O
women B-species
, O
in O
whom O

sites O

but O
what O

this O
preferential O

is O
not O
known O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
putative O
tissue-specific O
activities O
of O
BRCA O
, O
such O
as O
its O
effect O
on O

, O
may O
favor O

Beginning O

A O
recent O
study O
by O
Ganesan O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2002 O
) O
may O
provide O
some O
insights O
to O
the O
question O
of O
why O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
is O
a O
predisposing O
factor O
for O
hereditary O
cancer O
syndromes O
more O
frequently O
in O
women B-species
than O
in O
men B-species
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
is O
found O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
X-chromosome O
inactivation O
, O
which O
is O
a O
process O
specific O
to O
female O
cells O
. O

Moreover O
, O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
cells O
lacking O
BRCA1 B-gene
show O
evidence O
of O
defects O
in O
X-chromatin O
structure O
. O

Such O
defects O
could O
be O
reversed O
by O
the O
expression O
of O
wild-type O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

In O
support O
of O
this O
model O
, O
a O
preliminary O
study O
suggests O
that O
X-inactivation O
may O
not O
be O
a O
random O
process O
in O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
process O
is O
in O
some O
ways O
favorably O
occurring O
on O
the O
alternative O
X-chromosome O
carrying O
the O
wild-type O
BRCA1 B-gene
allele O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
combination O
of O
a O
germline O
mutation O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
as O
well O
as O
nonrandom O
X-chromosome O
inactivation O
could O
eliminate O
wild-type O
activity O
of O
this O
gene O
and O
thus O
contributes O
to O
the O
increased O
incidence O
of O
cancer O
in O
these O
females O
. O

However O
, O
further O
experiments O
will O
be O
required O
to O
verify O
this O
issue O
. O

It O
is O
also O
intriguing O
to O
ask O
whether O
such O
properties O
could O
be O
related O
to O
the O
abnormal O
nuclear O
structure O
seen O
in O
high-risk O
ovaries O
described O
earlier O
in O
this O
review O
. O

BRCA1 O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
interact O
with O
the O
estrogen O
receptor O
( O
ER O
) O
and O
inhibit O
both O
ligand-dependent O
and O
-independent O
ER O
activation O
. O

Estrogen O
is O
a O
principal O
determinant O
in O
the O
epithelial O
cell O
proliferation O
, O
differentiation O
and O
normal O
functional O
status O
of O
breast O
and O
ovary O
, O
which O
are O
both O
estrogen-responsive O
organs O
. O

Therefore O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
might O
possibly O
promote O
the O
growth O
and O
differentiation O
of O
ovarian O
and O
mammary O
epithelial O
cells O
through O
regulation O
of O
estrogen O
receptor O
activity O
, O
and O
by O
implication O
, O
contribute O
to O
the O
initiation O
of O
ovarian B-disease
and I-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

However O
, O
it O
seems O
confusing O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
have O
never O
been O
linked O
to O
tumors O
of O
other O
estrogen-responsive O
tissues O
, O
including O
the O
endometrium O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
not O
mutually O
exclusive O
with O
the O
model O
described O
above O
, O
certain O
oxidative O
forms O
of O
estrogen O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
genotoxic O
, O
and O
BRCA1 O
has O
been O
proposed O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
protecting O
breast O
and O
ovarian O
tissue O
from O
estrogen-induced O
DNA O
damage O
. O

BRCA1 O
has O
also O
been O
documented O
to O
enhance O
androgen-dependent O
transactivation O
by O
androgen O
receptor O
, O
allelic O
variants O
of O
which O
could O
modify O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
penetrance O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

BRCA1-/- O
mouse B-species
embryos O
exhibit O
early O
embryonic O
lethality O
, O
which O
hinders O
the O
study O
of O
the O
tumor O
suppression O
activity O
of O
BRCA1 O
. O

Mice B-species
heterozygous O
for O
mutations O
in O
either O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
have O
been O
generated O
. O

Although O
these O
mice B-species
are O
not O
predisposed O
to O
mammary O
or O
ovarian B-disease
tumor I-disease
development O
, O
they O
display O
defects O
in O
mammary O
duct O
branching O
and O
atrophic O
ovaries O
with O
significantly O
arrested O
follicular O
development O
in O
response O
to O
estrogen O
. O

The O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease
tumors I-disease
increases O
when O
the O
mice B-species
were O
crossed O
into O
a O
p53+/- O
background O
, O
consistent O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
loss O
of O
BRCA B-gene
gene O
alone O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
confer O
tumor O
formation O
and O
requires O
the O
accumulation O
of O
addition O
mutations O
in O
genes O
for O
checkpoint O
controls O
, O
including O
the O
inactivation O
of O
p53 O
. O

Conclusion O
One O
reason O
for O
the O
high O
mortality O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
that O
almost O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
disease O
is O
diagnosed O
at O
a O
late O
stage O
when O
disease O
has O
spread O
beyond O
pelvis O
. O

However O
, O
if O
a O
woman B-species
is O
diagnosed O
with O
an O
early O
stage O
( O
stage O
I O
) O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
survival O
rate O
is O
close O
to O
90 O
% O
without O
altering O
current O
therapeutic O
approaches O
. O

Data O
presented O

suggest O
that O
ovaries O
removed O
prophylactically O
from O
women B-species

may O
appear O
macroscopically O

however O
, O
a O
careful O

examination O
may O
reveal O
a O
number O
of O
cancer-prone O

perhaps O
even O

about O
15-20 O

Individuals O

in O
the O

Most O
pathogenic O
ATM B-gene
mutations O
described O
so O
far O
( O
now O
in O
excess O
of O
300 O
) O
result O
in O
truncating O
mutations O
that O

little O
or O
no O

ATM O

, O
but O
pathogenic O
missense O

have O
also O
been O
described O
. O

About O
1 O
% O
of O
the O
population O
are O
asymptomatic O
heterozygous O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
because O
the O
ATM O
protein O
forms O
high-molecular-mass O
complexes O
, O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
heterozygous O
missense O
mutations O
( O
or O
certain O
truncating O
mutations O
) O
could O
have O
a O
dominant-negative O
effect O
, O
interfering O
with O
the O
function O
of O
the O
normal O
allele O
and O
thereby O
resulting O
in O
an O
increased O
predisposition O
to O
cancer O
. O

Clinical O
observation O
and O
epidemiological O
studies O
since O
the O
1970s O
have O
shown O
that O
blood O
relatives O
of O
A-T B-disease
patients B-species
seem O
to O
be O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
suggesting O
that O
heterozygosity O
for O
mutations O
in O
the O
ATM B-gene
gene O
might O
predispose O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

After O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
gene O
in O
1995 O
, O
several O
studies O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
ATM B-gene
heterozygosity O
and O
increased O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

However O
, O
other O
studies O
have O
failed O
to O
demonstrate O
an O
association O
, O
concluding O
that O
the O
contribution O
of O
ATM B-gene
heterozygosity O
to O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
minimal O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
reconcile O
the O
different O
outcomes O
of O
these O
studies O
because O
they O
differed O
in O
sample O
size O
, O
in O
subject O
selection O
criteria O
, O
and O
in O
the O
mutation O
detection O
methods O
used O
. O

A O
recent O
study O
of O
multiple-case O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
in O
Australia O
suggested O
that O
two O
ATM B-gene
variants O
, O
ATM B-gene
7271T B-mutation
G I-mutation
and O
IVS10-6T B-mutation
G I-mutation
, O
confer O
a O
substantial O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease

in O
families O
with O
multiple O
cases O
. O

The O
ATM B-gene
7271T B-mutation
G I-mutation
missense O
variant O
was O
subsequently O
not O
detected O
in O
two O
large O
independent O
cohorts O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
variant O
is O
of O
limited O
clinical O
significance O
. O

The O
ATM B-gene
IVS10-6T B-mutation
G I-mutation
variant O
leads O
to O
incorrect O
splicing O
at O
exon O
11 O
and O
results O
in O
a O

product O
. O

In O
the O
Australian O
study O
, O
this O
variant O
was O
detected O
in O
2 O
of O
76 O
( O
2.6 O

In O
the O

with O
this O
variant O
, O
the O
penetrance O
( O
in O
terms O
of O

An O
earlier O
study O
had O
also O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
this O
variant O

cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

However O
, O
three O
subsequent O
studies O
in O
North O

identify O
a O

role O
for O
this O
variant O
in O
hereditary B-disease
or I-disease
sporadic I-disease
breast I-disease

. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
has O
been O
argued O
that O
the O
ATM B-gene
IVS10-6T B-mutation
G I-mutation
allele O
represents O
a O
biologically O
and O
clinically O
significant O
variant O
because O
ATM O
kinase O
activity O
is O
reduced O
to O
25-40 O
% O
in O
heterozygous O
cells O
. O

The O
possibility O
that O
ATM B-gene
IVS10-6T B-mutation
G I-mutation
could O
be O
a O
high-penetrance O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
allele O
, O
or O
even O
a O
low-penetrance O
risk-modifying O
allele O

has O

mutations O
and O
a O
further O
proband B-species
carried O
a O

This O
possible O
association O
is O
intriguing O
because O
ATM O
is O
known O
to O
phosphorylate O
BRCA1 O
, O
and O
BRCA1 O
has O
recently O
been O
shown O
to O
be O

functions O

the O
phosphorylation O

as O

that O

Further O
investigation O
of O
this O
variant O
as O
a O
low-penetrance O
modifier O
allele O
might O
be O
warranted O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
it O
has O
been O
argued O
that O
ATM B-gene
IVS10-6T B-mutation
G I-mutation
is O
a O
high-penetrance O
allele O
but O
our O
study O
has O
failed O
to O
support O
this O
view O
. O

Although O
this O
truncating O
variant O
has O
been O
postulated O
to O
act O
in O
a O
dominant-negative O
manner O
, O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
truncated O
product O
in O
heterozygotes O
has O
not O
been O
reported O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
product O
undergoes O
rapid O
degradation O
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
the O
variant O
allele O
produces O
less O
than O
10 O
% O
of O
full-length O
ATM B-gene
mRNA O
; O
it O
therefore O
remains O
possible O
that O
heterozygous O
carriers O
simply O
display O
reduced O
ATM O
levels O
and O
that O
the O
residual O
ATM O
kinase O
activity O
is O
sufficient O

Discussion O
Our O
study O
comprehensively O
evaluated O
the O
GATA3 B-gene
rs570613 B-mutation
SNP O
for O
association O
with O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
but O
failed O
to O
replicate O
the O
previous O
report O
of O
an O
association O
with O
risk O
. O

The O
BCAC O
analysis O
had O
~99 O
% O
power O
to O
detect O
an O
OR O
of O
the O
magnitudes O
previously O
reported O
( O
0.82-0.85 O
) O
, O
and O
the O
95 O
% O
CI O
for O
the O
per-allele O
OR O
( O
0.94-1.05 O
) O
shows O
that O
we O
can O
exclude O
all O
but O
very O
small O
associations O
. O

Likewise O
, O
GATA3 B-gene
rs570613 B-mutation
genotypes O
were O
not O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Results O
remained O
similar O
when O
analyses O
were O
adjusted O
for O
oophorectomy O
status O
in O
a O
time-dependent O
manner O
or O
when O
cases O
diagnosed O
more O
than O
five O
years O
before O
recruitment O
were O
excluded O
to O
account O
for O
possible O
survival O
bias O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
an O
association O
with O
ER O
status O
in O
BCAC O
studies O
but O
the O
number O
of O
ER-negative O
cases O
was O
limited O
to O
868 O
, O
and O
hence O
the O
95 O
% O
CI O
was O
wider O
( O
0.91-1.13 O
) O
. O

However O
, O
most O
BRCA1-associated O
tumors O
are O
ER-negative O
, O
so O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
association O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
association O
with O
ER-negative O
disease O
. O

The O
potential O
for O
variation O
in O
study-specific O
estimates O
is O
inherent O
in O
consortium O
analyses O
involving O
multiple O
studies O
. O

However O
, O
all O
BCAC O
studies O
selected O
controls O
from O
the O
same O
source O
population O
as O
cases O
, O
participants B-species
being O
predominantly O
Caucasian O
. O

There O
was O
no O

In O
summary O
, O
the O
role O
of O
GATA3 O
in O
breast B-disease
tumor I-disease
biology O
and O

has O
been O
well O
documented O
and O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
variants O
in O
GATA3 B-gene
might O
influence O
breast B-disease

is O
appealing O

However O
, O

convincingly O
that O
neither O
rs570613 B-mutation

nor O
any O
SNP O
in O

Conclusion O
This O

shows O
that O
carriers O
of O

in O
a O

gene O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
( O

; O
that O
is O
, O
over O
and O
above O
the O
risk O
associated O
with O
their O
carrier O
status O
. O

The O
increased O
risk O
indicates O
that O

of O
germline O
status O
of O
these O
DDRP O
genes O
at O
the O
time O

may O
have O
important O

Introduction O
Several O
risk O
factors O
for O
the O
development O
of O
breast B-disease

, O
such O
as O
family O
history O
, O
reproductive O
factors O
and O
exposure O
to O
radiation O
, O
have O
been O
identified O
. O

Out O
of O
all O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
5 O
to O
10 O
% O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
germline O
mutations O
in O
familial O
high-risk O
genes O
such O
as O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
that O
result O
in O
a O
lifetime O
breast B-disease

risk O
of O
about O
45 O
to O
65 O
% O
. O

The O
penetrance O
varies O
between O
families O
, O
depending O
on O
'risk O
modifiers O
' O
such O
as O
hormonal O
factors O
, O
mutation O
type O
and O
also O
exposure O
to O
radiation O
. O

Mutations O
in O
low-penetrance O
genes O
may O
account O
for O
a O
larger O
proportion O
( O
10 O
to O
30 O
% O
) O
of O
all O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

The O
contribution O
of O
these O
genes O
might O
be O
explained O
by O
their O
role O
in O
the O
DNA-damage O
control O
pathway O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
ATM B-gene
heterozygous O
carriers O
have O
a O
relative O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
of O
2.2 O
compared O
with O
the O
general O

and O
a O
relative O
risk O
of O
4.9 O
for O
those O
younger O
than O
50 O
years O
of O

. O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O

alterations O
in O
the O
ATM B-gene

are O
associated O
with O

has O
been O

a O

as O
a O

of O
all O
women B-species

Exposure O
to O

is O
a O

for O
breast B-disease

. O

A O
pooled O
analysis O
of O
eight O

showed O
that O
the O

is O
directly O
proportional O
to O
the O
radiation O
dose O
received O
and O
inversely O
related O
to O
age O
at O

. O

For O
women B-species
exposed O
at O
the O
age O
of O
25 O
years O
the O
excess O
relative O
risk O
per O
Gy O
was O
estimated O
to O

. O

The O
increased O
incidence O
of O

in O
the O

; O
their O
involvement O
in O

and O
their O

make O
them O
excellent O
candidates O
as O
genes O
with O
a O

The O

However O

Women B-species

of O
developing O
a O

in O
the O

. O

The O

explained O
by O
the O

the O

We O
present O
evidence O

Women B-species

have O
in O

a O
threefold O
to O

increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
a O

in I-disease

The O
15-year O

to O
10 O

in O

In O
a O
recent O
study O
, O
based O
on O
a O
consecutive O
series O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
under O
50 O
years O
of O
age O
, O
unselected O
for O

, O
we O
showed O
that O
CHEK2 B-gene

1100delC B-mutation
carriers O
have O
a O
twofold O
increased O
risk O
of O
second O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
found O
that O
mutation O

have O
an O
additional O
excess O
risk O
, O
compared O
with O
non-carriers O
, O
of O
developing O
CBC B-disease
during O
follow-up O
if O
they O
received O
RT O
for O
their O
first O
breast B-disease
tumour I-disease
. O

The O
increased O
risk O
due O
to O
RT O
exposure O
in O
carriers O
was O
mainly O
seen O
from O
5 O
years O
after O
RT O
( O
Table O

) O
. O

This O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
analysis O
of O
Boice O
and O
colleagues O
, O
who O
suggested O
previously O
that O
cancers O
resulting O
from O
an O
exposure O
to O
radiation O
would O
develop O
within O
predictable O
time O
windows O
; O
a O
latency O
period O
of O
at O
least O
5 O
to O
10 O
years O
was O
suggested O
for O
second O
primaries O
. O

Metcalf O
and O
colleagues O
have O
shown O
that O
RT O
actually O
protects O
against O
local O
recurrences O
and O
ipsilateral O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

Age O
at O
time O
of O
exposure O
is O
known O
to O
be O
a O
major O
determinant O
of O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Our O
data O
also O
suggest O
that O
carriers O
in O
the O
younger O
age O
group O
at O
the O
time O
of O
exposure O
( O
less O
than O
40 O
years O
old O
) O
showed O
the O
highest O
risk O
of O
developing O
radiation-associated O
CBC B-disease
, O
although O
the O
difference O
from O
those O
above O
40 O
years O
of O
age O
at O
RT O
was O
not O
significant O
( O

. O

Importantly O
, O
the O
mean O
and O
median O
ages O
at O
diagnosis O
of O
the O

primary O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
were O
the O
same O
in O
the O
CBC B-disease
patients B-species
with O
and O
without O
prior O
RT O
and O
in O
CBC B-disease
patients B-species
with O

without O
a O
germline O

, O
resulting O
in O
the O

both O

Indeed O
, O
adjustment O
for O

did O
not O

estimates O

The O
association O
between O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
and O
low-dose O
radiation O
has O
been O
a O
subject O
of O
debate O
. O

Recently O
we O
showed O
that O
diagnostic O
ionising O
radiation O
exposure O
from O
chest O
X-rays O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
significantly O
increased O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
among O
women B-species
who O
carry O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
pathogenic O
germline O
mutations O
. O

Comparable O
findings O
were O
reported O
for O
CHEK2 B-gene
* O
1100delC B-mutation
carriers O
by O
Bernstein O
and O
colleagues O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
included O
women B-species
exposed O
to O
higher O
doses O
from O
therapeutic O
RT O
, O
in O
whom O
the O
contralateral O
breast O
is O
exposed O
to O
about O
1 O
to O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
total O
dose O
( O
namely O
1 O
to O
6 O
Gy O
) O
, O
increasing O
the O
likelihood O
of O
detecting O
a O
gene-radiation O
interaction O
. O

The O
average O
( O
mean O
and O
median O
) O
maximum O
radiation O
dose O
( O
about O
1.5 O
Gy O
) O
and O
the O
dose O
at O
the O
site O
of O
the O
tumour O
( O
about O
1.8 O
Gy O
) O
measured O
in O
this O
study O
were O
found O
to O
be O
comparable O
between O
carriers O
and O
non-carriers O
. O

According O
to O
Preston O
and O
colleagues O
, O
the O
excess O
relative O
risk O
at O
1 O
Gy O
is O
2 O
, O
implying O
that O
mutation O
carriers O
may O
have O
an O
excess O
relative O
risk O
of O
about O
2.5 O
times O
this O
risk O
. O

We O
increased O
the O
power O
of O
our O
analysis O
by O
investigating O
the O
effect O
of O
four O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
genes O
together O
, O
considering O
them O
as O
a O
DNA O
repair O
gene O
group O
. O

These O
genes O
are O
all O
involved O
in O
DNA O
damage O
response O
triggered O
by O
damage O
induced O
by O
ionising O
radiation O
. O

An O
efficient O
response O
to O
DNA O
damage O
is O
essential O
for O
cellular O
life O
. O

The O
most O
detrimental O
form O
of O
damage O
is O
DNA O
double-strand O
breaks O
, O
which O
can O
be O
induced O
by O
ionising O
radiation O
and O
are O
lethal O
to O
the O
cell O
if O
not O
repaired O
. O

If O
repaired O
incorrectly O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
improper O
functioning O
of O
the O
repair O
machinery O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
genes O
implicated O
, O
double-strand O
breaks O
can O
lead O
to O
carcinogenesis O
through O
translocation O
, O
inversions O
or O
deletions O
of O
genetic O
material O
. O

Although O
the O
relative O
impact O
of O
germline O
mutations O
in O
the O
separate O
genes O
studied O
in O
response O
to O
RT O
is O
unknown O
, O
all O
of O
these O
genes O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
crucial O
to O
the O
repair O
of O
RT-induced O
double-strand O
breaks O
. O

We O
therefore O
considered O
it O
justified O
to O
regard O
these O
genes O
together O
as O
a O
DNA O
repair O
gene O
group O
in O
our O
analyses O
. O

Although O
we O
screened O
for O
only O
a O
subset O
of O
all O
mutations O
in O
the O
four O
genes O
, O
there O
is O
no O
biological O
evidence O
that O
undetected O
mutations O
would O
have O
occurred O
more O
often O
in O
the O
non-RT O
group O
. O

In O
a O
case-only O
study O
there O
must O
be O
independence O
between O
exposure O
( O
RT O
) O
and O
genotype O
( O
mutation O
) O
. O

By O
selecting O
the O
RT-exposed O
and O
non-RT-exposed O
groups O
of O
CBC B-disease
patients B-species
we O
might O
have O
consistently O
selected O
for O
those O
clinico-pathological O
factors O
determining O
the O
use O
of O
radiotherapy O
. O

If O
mutation O
carriers O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
receive O
RT O
for O
primary O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
for O
example O
because O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
family O
history O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
alerting O
the O
physician O
to O
a O
potentially O
more O
aggressive O
course O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
selection O

might O
arise O
in O
our O
case-only O
study O
. O

However O
, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
, O
mutation O

did O
not O
receive O
RT O
more O
often O
. O

Information O
about O
a O

history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
was O
obtained O
by O
a O
mailed O
questionnaire O
and O
from O
medical O

. O

In O
our O
study O
population O
53 O
% O
of O
the O

reported O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
family O
( O
33 O

, O
in O

From O
the O
data O
collected O
from O
medical O
records O
and O
risk O
factor O
questionnaires O
of O
all O
women B-species
, O
we O
concluded O
that O
DDRP O

had O
clinico-pathological O
features O
( O
such O
as O
size O
and O
stage O
) O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
'sporadic O
' O
cases O
. O

Adjustment O
for O
each O
of O
these O
factors O
in O
logistic O

analysis O
did O
not O
materially O
affect O
the O
risk O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
percentages O
of O
patients B-species

chemotherapy O
were O
comparable O
for O
mutation O

and O
non-carriers O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
genetic O
factors O
( O
the O
genetic O

was O
not O
known O
at O
time O
of O
treatment O
) O
under O
study O
did O
not O
affect O
treatment O
choice O
, O
justifying O
our O
assumption O
of O
independence O
between O
radiation O
and O
a O
mutation O
carrier O
status O
, O
which O
is O
needed O
for O
a O
case-only O
study O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O
a O

the O

in O
a O

of O
unselected O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
( O
diagnosis O
before O
50 O
years O

) O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
tumour O
characteristics O
of O
CHEK2 B-gene
* O
1100delC B-mutation
carriers O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
from O
those O

. O

Importantly O
, O
in O
that O
same O
study O
we O
also O
found O
that O
the O
proportion O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
receiving O
radiotherapy O
did O
not O
significantly O
differ O
between O
the O
CHEK2 B-gene
* O
1100delC B-mutation
carriers O
and O
non-carriers O
. O

Although O
the O
effect O
of O
pathogenic O
DDRP O
gene O
mutations O
on O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
seems O
evident O
, O
the O
role O
of O
most O
ATM B-gene
missense O
mutations O
remains O
unclear O
. O

Generally O
, O
the O
idea O
is O
that O
there O
are O
two O
groups O
of O
ATM B-gene
heterozygotes O
in O
the O
general O
population O
, O
each O
with O
different O
cancer O
risks O
: O
those O
with O
a O
wild-type O
and O
a O
truncating O
mutation O
allele O
and O
those O
with O
a O
wild-type O
and O
a O
missense O
mutation O
allele O
. O

Several O
epidemiological O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
relatives O
of O
patients B-species
with O
ataxia-telangiectasia B-disease
heterozygotic O
for O
an O
ATM B-gene
germline O
mutation O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Carriers O
of O
mutations O
predicted O
to O
encode O
a O
full-length O
ATM O
protein O
had O
cancer O
risks O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
people B-species
carrying O
truncating O
mutations O
, O
predicting O
that O
both O
type O
of O
mutation O
in O
these O
families O
are O
pathogenic O
for O
ataxia-telangiectasia B-disease
as O
well O
as O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Most O
studies O
try O
to O
predict O
the O
relevance O
of O
a O
particular O
mutation O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
co-segregation O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
, O
the O
location O
in O
a O
functional O
domain O
or O
interference O
with O
the O
splicing O
machinery O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
only O
a O
few O
studies O
have O
presented O
the O
functional O
analyses O
necessary O
to O
assess O
the O
biological O
impact O
of O
unidentified O
variants O
found O
frequently O
in O
ATM B-gene
. O

We O
found O
that O
ATM B-gene
missense O
mutations O
, O
those O
detected O
in O
our O
study O
, O
do O
not O
by O
themselves O
contribute O
to O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
after O
exposure O
to O
radiation O
. O

Although O
not O
significant O
, O
there O
might O
be O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
CBC B-disease
after O
RT O
when O
patients B-species
have O
both O
a O
pathogenic O
DDRP O
and O
an O
ATM B-gene
missense O
mutation O
( O
Table O
3 O
) O
. O

This O
trend O
suggests O
that O
ATM B-gene
missense O
mutations O
might O
have O
a O
risk-modifying O
effect O
after O
radiation O
exposure O
. O

It O
has O
been O
hypothesised O
that O
a O
multigenic O
model O
might O
explain O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
in O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
population O
. O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
, O
although O
mutations O
in O
certain O
genes O
had O
marginal O
or O
no O
associations O
with O
risk O
when O

in O
isolation O
, O
they O
showed O
significant O
association O
when O
combined O
with O

no O

who O
are O
not O

of O
any O
of O
the O

in O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
. O

Previous O
analyses O

a O
paucity O
of O
germline O
mutations O
in O
p53 B-gene

in O

: O
only O
two O

were O
identified O
among O
237 O
high-risk O
Norwegian O
individuals O
( O
Borresen O

the O

Thus O
, O
despite O
features O
suggesting O
that O
this O
might O
be O
a O
strong O
candidate O
underlying O

, O
p53 B-gene

It O
is O
still O
possible O
that O

An O
intriguing O

in O
the O

that O

Additionally O
, O
the O

suppressed O
effectively O
cellular O

the O

Discussion O
As O
missense O

have O
a O
higher O
likelihood O

in O

, O
we O

using O
VUS O
Predict O
, O
a O
model O
developed O
to O
classify O
BRCA B-gene

. O

Three O
of O
the O

were O

as O
variants O
of O
unknown O

and O
four O
were O
previously O

We O
found O
with O
our O
model O
and O
the O
model O

, O
that O
the O
L22S B-mutation

the O
T37K B-mutation

are O
likely O
to O
be O
pathogenic O
. O

We O
also O
classified O
the O
K45Q B-mutation

as O
neutral O
by O
both O
models O
. O

In O
our O
study O
the O

of O
some O
of O
the O
clinical O

such O
as O

revealed O
striking O
differences O
between O
probands B-species

. O

The O
families O
with O
the O
C44S B-mutation

classic O
for O
individuals O

The O

has O
a O
very O

Conversely O
, O
the O

who O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
neutral O
BRCA1 B-gene
change O
, O
K45Q B-mutation
, O
also O
had O
some O

but O
most O

. O

Limited O
family O

was O
available O
for O
the O
proband B-species
with O
the O
L22S B-mutation

. O

However O
, O
the O
L22S B-mutation
mutation O
was O
observed O
in O
one O
Japanese O
family O
whose O
proband B-species
had O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosed O

45 O
years O

and O
another O

and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosed O
at O
39 O
and O

years O

respectively O
. O

This O
family O
history O
is O
consistent O
with O
our O
classification O
of O
L22S B-mutation
as O

. O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
family O

, O
even O
in O
the O

The O

Functional O
studies O

that O
it O
disrupts O

the O

which O
results O
in O

. O

Several O
groups O
have O
developed O
different O
in O

to O
measure O
BRCA1 O

As O
BRCA1 O

it O
can O
be O
difficult O
to O
determine O
which O

. O

Despite O
the O
complexity O
, O
results O
from O

INTRODUCTION O
Since O
identification O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
cancer O
susceptibility O
genes O
, O
predictive O
models O
have O
been O
developed O
to O
identify O
individuals O
likely O
to O
carry O
inherited O
deleterious O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

These O
models O
assign O
a O
patient B-species
a O
probability O
of O
mutation O
carriage O
using O
the O
cancer O
histories O
of O
the O
patient B-species
and O
her O
first- O
, O
second-degree O
, O
and O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
more O
distant O
relatives O
, O
and O
estimates O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
prevalence O
and O
penetrance O
. O

The O
BRCAPRO O
model O
assumes O
that O
all O
genetic O
susceptibility O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
due O
to O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

The O
BOADICEA O
model O
considers O
the O
simultaneous O
effects O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
the O
residual O
familial O
clustering O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
not O
explained O
by O
these O
genes O
, O
which O
is O
assumed O
to O
be O
polygenic O
. O

Multiple O
studies O
have O
validated O
BRCAPRO O
's O
performance O
, O
and O
most O
have O
found O
it O
to O
discriminate O
as O
well O
as O
or O
more O
accurately O
than O
other O
models O
, O
although O
some O
studies O
suggest O
that O
BOADICEA O
performs O
slightly O
better O
in O
certain O
high-risk O
populations O
. O

Most O
evaluations O
of O
BRCAPRO O
and O
BOADICEA O
have O
included O
primarily O
non-Hispanic O
White O
( O
NHW O
) O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
with O
a O
few O
exceptions O
; O
consequently O
, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
performance O
of O
these O
models O
across O
different O
racial/ethnic O
groups O
. O

The O
BRCAPRO O
model O
was O
developed O
and O
has O
been O
validated O
with O
data O
from O
patients B-species
presenting O
for O
clinical O
genetics O
evaluation O
because O
of O
strong O
family O
cancer O
history O
; O
the O
BOADICEA O
model O
was O
developed O
using O
population-based O
data O
. O

As O
we O
and O
others O
have O
observed O
, O
a O
substantial O
portion O
of O
population-sampled O

breast B-disease

do O
not O
have O
a O

or I-disease

cancer I-disease
. O

Many O
women B-species
with O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
but O
no O
family O
history O
wish O
to O
know O
their O
mutation O

, O
because O
results O
may O

management O
of O

, O
and O

; O
such O
patients B-species
increasingly O
present O

. O

An O
accurate O
and O
precise O

based O
on O
personal O
and O

history O
could O
identify O
individuals O
who O

but O
who O
, O
if O

DISCUSSION O
We O
evaluated O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
BRCAPRO O
and O
BOADICEA O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
prediction O
models O
in O
three O
racial/ethnic O
groups O
, O
consisting O
of O
African-American O
, O
Hispanic O
and O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
NHW O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
from O
the O
San O
Francisco O
Bay O
Area O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O
compare O
these O
BRCA B-gene
mutation-prediction O
models O
across O
population O
samples O
of O
such O
racial/ethnic O
diversity O
. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
models O
showed O
similar O
discrimination O
within O
each O
racial/ethnic O
group O
, O
but O
differences O
in O
calibration O
: O
BRCAPRO O
under-predicted O
mutation O
carriage O
in O
Hispanics B-species
, O
whereas O
BOADICEA O
over-predicted O
mutations O
in O
African B-species
Americans I-species
and O
in O
older O
NHWs B-species
. O

The O
strength O
of O
this O
study O
is O
its O
focus O
on O
population-based O
samples O
of O
racial/ethnic O
minorities O
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
most O
prior O
evaluations O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
prediction O
models O
. O

Some O
prior O
studies O
have O
found O
similar O
accuracy O
of O
BRCAPRO O
in O
racial/ethnic O
minorities O
as O
in O
NHWs B-species
, O
but O
we O
and O
others O
reported O
under-prediction O
by O
BRCAPRO O
and O
other O
models O
among O
clinic-based O
minorities O
including O
Asian B-species
Americans I-species
and O
Hispanics B-species
. O

Models O
may O
perform O
less O
well O
in O
racial/ethnic O
minorities O
because O
the O
prevalence O
of O
carriers O
among O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
may O
differ O
by O
race/ethnicity O
. O

In O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
NHW O
cases O
, O
our O
prevalence O
estimates O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
2.1 O
% O
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
2.3 O
% O
) O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
used O
by O
the O
BRCAPRO O
and O
BOADICEA O
models O
; O
by O
contrast O
, O
we O
found O
that O
African-American O
cases O
had O
lower O
( O
BRCA1 B-gene
1.1 O
% O
; O
BRCA2 B-gene
1.8 O

) O
, O
and O

Notably O
, O
the O
exception O
to O
BOADICEA O

occurred O
in O
Hispanics B-species

as O
did O
a O

, O
both O
consistent O
with O
Hispanics B-species
' O
higher O

than O
observed O
in O
non-Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
NHWs B-species
. O

Within O
subsets O
specific O
for O
family O
history O
and O
age O
, O
calibration O
worsened O
with O
increasing O
divergence O
from O
the O
mutation O
prevalence O
expected O
by O
the O
models O
; O
for O
example O
, O
both O
models O
over-predicted O
significantly O
only O
in O
African B-species
Americans I-species
with O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
while O
under-predicting O
in O
Hispanics B-species
lacking O
such O
family O
history O
. O

Recent O
publications O
have O
reported O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
the O
185delAG B-mutation
BRCA1 B-gene
founder O
mutation O
in O
Hispanics B-species
than O
was O
initially O
appreciated O
, O
leading O
some O
to O
suggest O
a O
common O
origin O
for O
this O
mutation O
in O
Sephardic O
and O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
populations O
. O

The O
present O
results O
contrast O
with O
those O
from O
a O
recent O
single-center O
clinic-based O
study O
of O
BRCAPRO O
in O
Hispanics B-species
, O
which O
reported O
better O
model O
performance O
than O
we O
found O
; O
variations O
in O
the O
use O
of O
BRCAPRO O
between O
studies O
may O
explain O
some O
of O
this O
difference O
. O

Our O
finding O
of O
lesser O
BRCAPRO O
model O
accuracy O
in O
Hispanics B-species
also O
prompts O
questions O
as O
to O
whether O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
penetrance O
, O
or O
associated O
cancer O
risk O
, O
might O
differ O
between O
Hispanics B-species
and O
NHW B-species
. O

Given O
the O
growing O
size O
of O
the O
U.S. O
Hispanic O
population O
, O
further O
study O
of O
this O
issue O
has O
important O
implications O
for O
health O
policy O
and O
resource O
allocation O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
prior O
studies O
of O
the O
calibration O
of O
BRCAPRO O
and O
similar O
models O
in O
clinic-based O
settings O
, O
this O
analysis O
considered O

with O

) O

This O
study O
sample O
reflects O
the O
reality O
of O
current O
clinical O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O

, O
given O
patient B-species

Introduction O
Within O
the O

breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
commonest O
malignancy O
in O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
approximately O
one O
in O
12 O
women B-species
will O
develop O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
their O
lifetime O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
( O
95 O
% O
) O
are O
sporadic O
; O
only O
a O
small O
proportion O
, O
particularly O
those O
diagnosed O
in O
young O
women B-species
, O
are O
due O
to O
a O
highly O
penetrant O
autosomal-dominant O
trait O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
5 O
years O
there O
has O
been O
considerable O
progress O
in O
the O
identification O
and O
localization O
of O
the O
genes O
responsible O
for O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Two O
in O
particular O
have O
grabbed O
the O
headlines O
; O
these O
are O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

For O
more O
than O
50 O
years O
, O
researchers O
have O
been O
fascinated O
by O
the O
association O
of O
histopathological O
cancer O
type O
with O
a O
positive O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease

than O
have O
other O
subtypes O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
reported O
studies O
have O
been O
difficult O
to O
interpret O
because O
of O
the O
small O
number O
of O
samples O
, O
the O
differing O
criteria O
for O
a O
positive O
family O
history O
and O
the O
controversies O
surrounding O
the O
classification O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
histopathological O
classification O
of O
breast B-disease
disease I-disease
is O
subjective O
and O
, O
despite O
an O
attempt O
to O
provide O
clear O
guidelines O
, O
the O
interobserver O
variability O
is O
known O
to O
be O
high O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
subjective O
nature O
of O
histological O
examination O
and O
the O
factors O
outlined O
above O
, O
no O
clear O
agreement O
has O
emerged O
that O
any O
particular O

is O
more O
commonly O

than O
any O

Marcus O

reported O
the O

. O

In O
their O
study O
, O
they O
assigned O

The O
control O

187 O
predominantly O

The O
tumours O
were O
analyzed O
for O
histological O
type O
, O
grade O
, O
ploidy O
and O
S-phase O
fraction O
. O

The O
investigators O
found O
that O
BRCA1-associated O
tumours O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
of O
medullary O
or O
atypical O
medullary O
type O
, O

, O
were O
more O
frequently O
aneuploid O

rates O
. O

The O

significance O
when O

Recently O
the O
pathology O
of O
breast B-disease

BRCA1 B-gene

were O
examined O
in O
a O
very O
large O
, O
collaborative O
study O
organized O
through O
the O
Breast O

, O
and O
the O
histological O

with O
those O
in O

individuals O
who O
did O
not O

There O
were O
118 O
( O

The O

548 O
breast B-disease

Seven O
pathologists O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
had O
experience O
of O
breast O
pathology O
, O
carried O
out O
the O
review O
. O

The O
pathologists O
were O
unaware O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
slides O
were O
from O
the O
familial O
or O
sporadic O
cases O
. O

The O
cancers O
were O
typed O
and O
graded O
using O
the O
criteria O
used O
by O
the O
UK O
National O
Breast O
Screening O
Programme O
as O
follows O
. O

They O
were O
graded O
by O
giving O
a O
score O
of O
1-3 O
for O
each O
parameter O
. O

If O
more O
than O
75 O
% O
of O
the O
tumour O
has O
good O
tubules O
, O
the O
score O
is O
1 O
; O
if O
less O
than O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
tumour O
has O
good O

, O
the O
score O
is O
3 O
. O

For O
pleomorphism O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
degree O
of O
pleomorphism O
, O
the O
worse O
the O
score O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
higher O
the O
mitotic O

per O
10 O
high-power O

, O
the O
higher O
the O
score O
. O

Total O
scores O
of O
3-5 O
, O
6-7 O

mean O
that O
the O

, O
respectively O
. O

The O
results O
from O
this O
large O
review O
of O
histopathological O
material O
produced O
some O
intriguing O
findings O
. O

No O
differences O
were O
found O
, O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
control O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
in O
the O
proportion O
of O
the O

of O
no O

. O

In O
keeping O
with O
the O
study O
by O
Marcus O
et O
al O
, O
more O
carcinomas O
were O
recorded O
as O
medullary O
or O
atypical O
medullary O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
group O
( O
14 O
% O
) O
than O
in O
the O
control O
group O
( O
2 O
% O
; O
P O
< O
0.0001 O
) O
. O

The O
overall O
grade O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
was O
significantly O
higher O
than O
that O
in O
the O
control O
population O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

Interestingly O
the O
higher O
grade O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
was O
a O
result O
of O
higher O
score O
of O
all O
three O
parameters O
of O
grade O
( O
tubule O
formation O
, O
pleomorphism O
and O
mitosis O
) O
. O

The O
presence O
of O
in-situ O
disease O
was O
also O
recorded O
from O
the O
analysis O
. O

The O
results O
do O
not O
represent O
an O
accurate O
assessment O
of O
the O
presence O
or O
extent O
of O
in-situ O
disease O
, O
because O
the O
breasts O
of O
neither O
the O
control O
nor O
familial O
patients B-species
were O
examined O
extensively O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
sampling O
problem O
for O
the O
in-situ O
disease O
was O
the O
same O
for O
both O
familial O
and O
control O
patients B-species
. O

Ductal B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in I-disease
situ I-disease
was O
seen O
less O
frequently O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
cases O
( O
41 O
% O
) O
than O
in O
control O
individuals O
( O
56 O
% O
; O
P O
= O

. O

Lobular B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in I-disease

was O
also O
seen O
less O
frequently O
in O
control O
individuals O
, O
but O
the O
results O
were O
not O
statistically O
significant O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
strong O
associations O
of O
the O
medullary O
and O
atypical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
with O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
phenotype O
, O
a O
further O
review O
to O
identify O
the O
features O
that O
were O
predictive O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
phenotype O
was O
carried O
out O
. O

Medullary O
carcinoma O
is O
a O
controversial O
entity O
. O

It O
is O
defined O
as O
a O
tumour O
that O
grows O
in O
solid O
sheets O
within O
an O
indistinct O
cell O
border O
( O
syncytial O
growth O
pattern O
) O
, O
has O
large O
vesicular O
nuclei O
and O
prominent O
nucleoli O
, O
a O
broad O
pushing O
margin O
and O
a O
prominent O
lymphocytic O
infiltrate O
both O
at O
the O
periphery O
and O
within O
the O
tumour O
. O

These O
features O
must O
be O
present O
in O
the O
entire O
tumour O
for O
it O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
classical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
. O

If O
the O
tumour O
has O
less O
lymphocytic O
infiltrate O
or O
an O
infiltrating O
margin O
in O
part O
of O
the O
tumour O
, O
it O
is O
regarded O
as O
an O
atypical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
. O

The O
presence O
of O
a O
classical O
ductal B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
of O
no O
special O
type O
forming O
less O
than O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
tumour O
also O
pushes O
it O
into O
an O
atypical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
category O
. O

Although O
these O
features O
appear O
to O
be O
fairly O
specific O
, O
pathologists O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
difficulty O
in O
making O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
medullary O
and O
atypical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
, O
and O
, O
as O
in O
this O
study O
, O
the O
interobserver O
agreement O
is O
low O
. O

Hence O
, O
in O
the O
second O
review O
the O
pathologists O
were O
asked O
to O
evaluate O
specific O
features O
, O
rather O
than O
assigning O
a O
specific O
type O
to O
the O
tumour O
. O

They O
were O
asked O
to O
complete O
a O
proforma O
that O
included O
the O
following O
: O
an O
assessment O
of O
the O
percentage O
of O
tumour O
present O
as O
solid O
sheets O
of O
cells O
( O
< O
25 O
% O
, O
25-75 O
% O
, O
> O
75 O
% O
) O
; O
the O
total O
mitotic O
count O
per O
10 O
high-power O
fields O
; O
the O
presence O
of O
continuous O
pushing O
margins O
; O
the O
presence O
of O
confluent O
necrosis O
; O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
lymphocytic O
infiltrate O
; O
and O
, O
if O
present O
, O
whether O
mild O
or O
prominent O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
discernible O
cell O
borders O
; O
the O
presence O
of O
vesicular O
nuclei O
; O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
prominent O
eosinophilic O
nucleoli O
. O

In O
a O
multifactorial O
analysis O
using O
the O
data O
from O
both O
reviews O
, O
the O
only O
factors O
found O
to O
be O
significant O
were O
total O
mitotic O
count O
, O
continuous O
pushing O
margins O
, O
and O
lymphocytic O
infiltrate O
( O
Fig O
. O
2 O
and O
3 O
) O
. O

All O
other O
features O
including O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
medullary O
and O
atypical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
were O
no O
longer O
significant O
in O
this O
multifactorial O
analysis O
. O

Two O
of O
the O
three O
features O
that O
are O
independently O
associated O
with O
cancers O
from O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
patient B-species
( O
continuous O
pushing O
margins O
and O
lymphocytic O
infiltrate O
) O
are O
part O
of O
the O
subset O
of O
the O
characteristics O
that O
define O
medullary O
carcinoma O
. O

High O
mitotic O
count O
, O
which O
is O
the O
third O
feature O
associated O
with O
these O
tumours O
, O
is O
also O
often O
seen O
in O
medullary O
carcinomas O
, O
because O
these O
tend O
to O
be O
of O
higher O
grade O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
regarded O
as O
a O
defining O
feature O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
, O
although O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
frequency O
of O
classical O
and O
atypical O
medullary O
carcinoma O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
observed O
BRCA1 B-gene
phenotype O
, O
these O
cancers O
probably O
account O
for O
only O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
the O
differences O
observed O
between O
those O
with O
and O
those O
without O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Histopathological O
features O
of O
BRCA2-associated O
tumours O
Unlike O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
data O
on O
the O
pathology O
of O
tumours O
associated O
with O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
limited O
. O

The O
study O
by O
Marcus O
et O
al O
attempted O
to O
delineate O
the O
pathology O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
. O

Their O
study O
groups O
comprised O
BRCA1-associated O
tumours O
and O
'others O
' O
, O
which O
included O
BRCA2 B-gene
cases O
. O

Although O
this O
latter O
group O
included O
85 O
patients B-species
, O
only O
nine O
were O
linked O
to O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
and O
three O
were O
of O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
authors O
suggested O
that O
tumours O
arising O
in O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
different O
from O
those O
arising O
in O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

These O
tumours O
were O
of O
lower O
grade O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumours O
, O
were O
less O
aneuploid O
, O
and O
did O
not O
have O
the O
high O
proliferation O
seen O
in O
tumours O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
patients B-species
. O

They O
found O
an O
association O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
with O
invasive B-disease
lobular I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
tubular-lobular B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
tubular O
carcinoma O
and O
cribriform B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
which O
they O
designated O
as O
a O
'tubular-lobular O
group O
' O
. O

This O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
findings O
of O
Agnarsson O
et O
al O
, O
who O
found O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
in O
the O
Icelandic O
population O
were O
of O
higher O
grade O
than O
that O
in O
sporadic O
cases O
. O

Their O
data O
are O
, O
however O
, O
based O
on O
one O
particular O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
- O
999del5 B-mutation
- O
and O
hence O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
rule O
out O
that O
this O
phenotype O
represents O
a O
peculiarity O
of O
this O
particular O
mutation O
. O

The O
studies O

represents O
the O
largest O

Unlike O
in O
the O

by O
Marcus O

, O
no O

in O
the O

In O

Interestingly O
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
the O
higher O
grade O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene

was O
only O
due O
to O

Conclusion O
The O
studies O
to O

indicate O
that O
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
arising O
in O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene

different O
from O
those O
arising O
in O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
from O
non-familial O

. O

The O
principle O
differences O
are O
in O
total O
mitotic O
count O
, O
tubule O

and O

. O

Patients B-species

have O
a O
high O
rate O
of O

together O
, O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
clinical O
phenotypes O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O

that O
the O
biological O
