Previous O

have O

to O
assess O
potential O

, O
and O
some O
have O
observed O

Most O
of O
these O
studies O
are O
limited O
by O
a O
small O
sample O
size O
and O
a O
focus O
on O
germ-line O
founder O

and O
thus O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
statistical O
power O
to O
allow O
adequate O
differentiation O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene

Our O
study O
provides O
a O
more O
representative O
spectrum O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
than O
have O
previous O
studies O
, O
given O
that O
only O
7 O

the O

were O
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
background O
and O
27 O
% O
of O
our O
BRCA-positive O
patients B-species
had O
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
. O

Our O
analyses O
of O
chemotherapy O
response O
confirmed O
our O
observations O
regarding O
survival O
by O
demonstrating O
that O
all O
BRCA2-mutated O
cases O
had O
significantly O
higher O
chemotherapy O
sensitivity O
rates O
and O
longer O
platinum-free O
durations O
than O
did O
BRCA1-mutated O
and O
wt O
BRCA B-gene
cases O
. O

In O

with O
our O
observations O
for O
prognosis O
and O
chemotherapy O
response O
, O
BRCA2-mutated O
cases O
, O
but O
not O
BRCA1-mutated O

, O
exhibited O
a O
`` O

'' O
that O
contained O
significantly O
more O
mutations O
, O
as O
determined O
from O
whole-exome O

. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
different O
associations O
between O
survival O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
deficiencies O
likely O
result O
from O
patients B-species
' O
distinct O
responses O
to O
platinum-based O
treatment O
, O
which O
may O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
differing O
nature O
of O
the O
dysfunction O
of O
these O
two O
genes O
. O

Differences O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene

have O
been O
suggested O
by O
the O
results O
of O
previous O
studies O
. O

Clinically O
, O
although O
germ-line O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
result O
in O
a O
higher O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease

, O
carriers O
of O
these O
genes O
have O
different O
risk O
factors O
. O

Unlike O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
, O
which O
are O
almost O
exclusively O
associated O
with O
female O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease

, O
BRCA2 B-gene
families O
also O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
pancreatic B-disease
and I-disease

cancers I-disease
. O

Functionally O
, O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
been O
reported O
to O
play O
key O
roles O
in O
DNA O
damage O
repair O
, O
but O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
distinct O
but O
complementary O
functions O
. O

BRCA2 O
's O
primary O
function O
appears O
to O
be O
regulation O
of O
RAD51 O
protein O
, O
which O
is O
required O
for O
double-strand O
break O
repair O
by O
homologous O
recombination O
. O

It O
has O
been O
established O
by O
several O

groups O
that O

are O

and O
undergo O
a O

The O

predispose O

not O

as O
we O
observed O

Our O

that O

are O
differentially O

that O
this O

may O
be O
a O
result O

However O

there O
are O

Although O
the O

( O

In O

, O
the O
associations O

do O
not O

that O

Even O
a O

The O

remains O
unknown O
, O
although O

studies O

suggest O
the O
prevalence O
is O
between O
5 O

The O
penetrance O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

incomplete O

and O
a O

molecular O
genetic O
sequence O

BRCA1/2-associated O

A O
clearer O
understanding O

the O

in O
BRCA1/2-associated O
PDAC B-disease

necessary O
for O

In O
the O

given O
the O

Prior O
studies O

shown O
an O

the O

. O

The O
association O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene

PDAC B-disease
is O
less O

. O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
play O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
hereditary O
PDAC B-disease
through O

We O
aimed O

in O
an O

alterations O
and O
environmental O
exposures O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
as O
compared O
with O
PDAC B-disease
, O
leading O
to O
different O
cancer O
manifestations O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
PDAC B-disease
in O
patients B-species
who O
carry O
a O
germline O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
is O
poorly O
defined O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
report O
an O
increased O
prevalence O
of O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
founder O
mutations O
in O
an O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
surgical O
cohort O
of O
patients B-species
with O
PDAC B-disease
and O
IPMN B-disease
with O
LOH O
in O
the O
PDAC B-disease
at O
the O
corresponding O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
loci O
. O

Although O
our O
study O
is O
blinded O
to O
whether O
the O
patients B-species
knew O
their O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
status O
, O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
could O
reflect O
a O
referral O
bias O
to O
our O
Pancreas O
Center O
of O
patients B-species
with O
known O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

However O
, O
no O
patients B-species
were O
ascertained O
for O
this O
study O
through O
a O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
screening O
program O
. O

We O
are O
also O
limited O
only O
to O
patients B-species
who O
underwent O
surgical O
pancreatic O
resection O
, O
therefore O
biasing O
toward O
patients B-species
who O
presented O
at O
an O
earlier O
stage O
of O
disease O
or O
who O
were O
otherwise O
deemed O
good O
surgical O
candidates O
. O

The O
true O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
may O
be O
lower O
than O
21.6 O
% O
in O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
patients B-species
with O
PDAC B-disease
across O
all O
stages O
of O
disease O
but O
likely O
remains O
above O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
frequency O
of O
2 O
% O
to O
3 O
% O
. O

Our O
study O
is O
also O
limited O
to O
those O
who O
self-identified O
as O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jewish I-species
in O
a O
single O
institution O
and O
examined O
only O
for O
the O
three O
common O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
retrospective O
nature O
of O
this O
study O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
data O
on O
the O
overall O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
entire O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
registry O
, O
but O
prospective O
studies O
using O
the O
registry O
are O
being O
undertaken O
. O

The O
overall O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
all O
ethnic O
groups O
is O
estimated O
at O
1:400 O
to O
1:800 O
, O
but O
few O
studies O
have O
examined O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
prevalence O
in O
diverse O
ethnic O
backgrounds O
. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
germline O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
present O
and O
causal O
in O
other O
ethnic O
backgrounds O
, O
although O
at O
this O
time O
the O
cost O
of O
comprehensive O
testing O
for O
these O
mutations O
is O
prohibitive O
for O
this O
study O
. O

Other O
groups O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
sequence O
of O
p53 B-gene
, O
Kras B-gene
, O
and O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
is O
critical O
in O
the O
progression O
to O
PDAC B-disease
. O

Rowley O
and O
colleagues O
found O
that O
in O
a O
murine B-species
model O
of O
PDAC B-disease
, O
p53 B-gene
mutations O
were O
required O
before O
BRCA2 B-gene
LOH O
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
co-existence O
of O
an O
activated O
Kras B-gene
mutation O
. O

Skoulidis O
and O
colleagues O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
heterozygote O
to O
the O
KPC O
mouse B-species
model O
was O
sufficient O
to O
promote O
Kras- O
and O
p53-driven O
tumorigenesis O
. O

The O
mechanism O
and O
order O
of O
somatic O
mutations O
in O
human B-species
BRCA1/2-associated O
tumorigenesis O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
studied O
. O

We O
show O
that O
p53 B-gene
mutations O
are O
present O
with O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
LOH O
and O
may O
promote O
pancreatic O
carcinogenesis O
, O
although O
the O
order O
of O
mutations O
can O
not O
be O
determined O
in O
this O
study O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
some O
tumors O
exhibit O
complete O
LOH O
with O
p53 O
staining O
, O
and O
some O
tumors O
contain O
a O
germline O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
without O
LOH O
or O
p53 O
staining O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
not O
all O
PDACs B-disease
inBRCA1/2 O
germline O
carriers O
are O
caused O
by O
LOH O
at O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
locus O
and O
that O
they O
may O
occur O
through O
a O
mechanism O
similar O
to O
sporadic O
PDAC B-disease
. O

Skoulidis O
and O
colleagues O
also O
examined O
an O
Icelandic O
registry O
for O
all O
patients B-species
with O
pancreatic B-disease
tumors I-disease
who O
carried O
the O
Icelandic O
founder O
mutation O
BRCA2 B-gene
999del5 B-mutation
and O
reported O
7 O
pancreatic B-disease
tumors I-disease
( O
3 O
acinar O
tumors O
and O
4 O
adenocarcinomas O
) O
in O
patients B-species
with O
germline O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
3 O
of O
the O
7 O
tumors O
in O
their O
cohort O
did O
not O
exhibit O
LOH O
. O

In O
the O
4 O
tumors O
in O
which O
LOH O
was O
described O
, O
3 O
of O
the O
tumors O
were O
of O
acinar O
histology O
. O

Acinar B-disease
tumors I-disease
of I-disease
the I-disease
pancreas I-disease
are O
rare O
, O
representing O
less O
than O
1 O
% O
of O
primary O
pancreatic B-disease
tumors I-disease
, O
and O
a O
review O
of O
our O
database O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
patients B-species
who O
underwent O
pancreatic O
resection O
for O
acinar O
tumors O
. O

Given O
the O
absence O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
LOH O
in O
PDACs B-disease
, O
Skoulidis O
and O
colleagues O
proposed O
an O
alternative O
model O
for O
the O
development O
of O
pancreatic B-disease
tumors I-disease
. O

They O
postulated O
that O
PDACs B-disease
develop O
in O
the O
background O
of O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutation O
if O
an O
activating O
Kras B-gene
mutation O
is O
present O
along O
with O
additional O
somatic O
genetic O
alterations O
. O

They O
further O
hypothesized O
that O
biallelic O
loss O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
with O
an O
activating O
Kras B-gene
mutation O
and O
inactivation O
of O
p53 B-gene
, O
may O
lead O
to O
tumors O
with O
variant O
histology O
such O
as O
acinar B-disease
tumors I-disease
. O

Under O
this O
model O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
LOH O
yields O
an O
adenocarcinoma O
after O
a O
prolonged O
delay O
, O
if O
at O
all O
. O

Whether O
or O
not O
biallelic O
inactivation O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
is O
present O
in O
PDACs B-disease
is O
critical O
from O
a O
therapeutic O
perspective O
, O
as O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumors O
with O
LOH O
may O
be O
sensitive O
to O
poly-ADP O
ribose O
polymerase O
( O
PARP O
) O
inhibitors O
. O

Neither O
the O
Skoulidis O
and O
colleagues O
study O
nor O
the O
present O
study O
fully O
evaluated O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
genes O
for O
other O
somatic O
mutations O
that O
may O
lead O
to O
biallelic O
loss O
. O

However O
, O
we O
show O
LOH O
of O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
some O
but O
not O
all O
BRCA1/2-associated O
PDACs B-disease
, O
suggesting O
PARP O
inhibitors O
may O
be O
useful O
in O
selected O
tumors O
exhibiting O
biallelic O
inactivation O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

Further O
analysis O
of O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
in O
PDACs B-disease
that O
do O
not O
show O
LOH O
may O
be O
indicated O
if O
therapy O
with O
PARP O
inhibitors O
is O
considered O
. O

PDACs B-disease
may O
develop O
in O
tissue O
with O
heterogeneity O
of O
somatic O
genetic O
changes O
. O

While O
nuclear O
accumulation O
of O
p53 O
protein O
is O
a O
surrogate O
marker O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
p53 B-gene
mutation O
, O
our O
immunohistochemistry O
( O
IHC O
) O
studies O
clearly O
show O
that O
the O
PDAC B-disease
tumors O
are O
genetically O
heterogeneous O
. O

Within O
a O
single O
tumor O
, O
different O
areas O
show O
differential O
positivity O
for O
p53 O
staining O
. O

Some O
areas O
of O
tumor O
are O
strongly O
positive O
for O
nuclear O
p53 O
staining O
, O
whereas O
other O
regions O
completely O
lack O
staining O
. O

Intratumor O
heterogeneity O
for O
p53 B-gene
mutations O
has O
been O
observed O
previously O
when O
preinvasive O
and O
invasive O
pancreatic O
lesions O
of O
the O
same O
patient B-species
were O
compared O
. O

Such O
genetic O
differences O
within O
the O
same O
neoplasm O
explain O
the O
variable O
p53 O
signal O
seen O
by O
IHC O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
among O
our O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
BRCA2 B-gene
germ-line O
carriers O
, O
one O
PDAC B-disease
was O
clearly O
identified O
as O
arising O
from O
an O
IPMN B-disease
. O

The O
IPMN B-disease
lesion O
was O
microdissected O
separately O
from O
the O
PDAC B-disease
, O
and O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
separately O
. O

The O
IPMN B-disease
revealed O
partial O
LOH O
, O
whereas O
the O
PDAC B-disease
showed O
complete O
LOH O
. O

This O
finding O
may O
suggest O
that O
the O
transition O
from O
a O
preneoplastic O
pancreatic O
lesion O
such O
as O
IPMN B-disease
to O
PDAC B-disease
requires O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
LOH O
in O
certain O
individuals O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
similar O
observations O
have O
been O
reported O
for O
PanIN-derived O
PDAC B-disease
among O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Although O
we O
feel O
this O
is O
further O
evidence O
that O
germline O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
causal O
in O
PDAC B-disease
tumorigenesis O
, O
even O
with O
careful O
microdissection O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
pancreatic B-disease
tumor I-disease
DNA O
is O
not O
pure O
tumor O
DNA O
, O
and O
this O
heterogeneity O
may O
affect O
our O
ability O
to O
detect O
LOH O
. O

Our O
study O
, O
as O
in O
previous O
studies O
, O
did O
not O
show O
a O
significant O
age O
difference O
between O
instances O
of O
sporadic O
and O
hereditary O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Further O
studies O
are O
under O
way O
to O
more O
definitively O
establish O
the O
age O
at O
which O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutations O
are O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
PDAC B-disease
. O

Survival O
and O
tumor O
histology O
are O
not O
different O
between O
BRCA1/2-associated O
tumors O
and O
other O
PDAC B-disease
, O
although O
the O
sample O
is O
underpowered O
for O
survival O
analyses O
controlled O
for O
age O
and O
invasion O
characteristics O
. O

As O
the O
association O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
may O
be O
causal O
in O
selected O
individuals O
with O
PDAC B-disease
, O
the O
next O
logical O
question O
is O
whether O
all O
patients B-species
carrying O
germline O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
should O
undergo O
screening O
for O
PDAC B-disease
. O

Our O
group O
and O
others O
have O
shown O
that O
PDAC B-disease
screening O
in O
selected O
high-risk O
individuals O
is O
successful O
at O
detection O
of O
early-stage O
PDAC B-disease
and O
high-grade O
dysplastic O
lesions O
in O
the O
pancreas O
. O

Genetic O
testing O
conducted O
at O
our O
institution O
for O
a O
family O
history O
of O
PDAC B-disease
has O
also O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
and O
resection O
of O
curable O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
hereditary B-disease
pancreatitis I-disease
and O
Peutz-Jeghers B-disease
syndrome I-disease
, O
current O
consensus O
guidelines O
do O
not O
recommend O
screening O
high-risk O
individuals O
for O
PDAC B-disease
before O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
. O

These O
guidelines O
, O
developed O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
expert O
opinion O
, O
recommend O
PDAC B-disease
screening O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
one O
first-degree O
relative O
with O
PDAC B-disease
, O
and O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
with O
two O
non-first-degree O
relatives O
with O
PDAC B-disease
. O

Although O
screening O
of O
selected O
high-risk O
individuals O
may O
be O
successful O
in O
the O
identification O
of O
these O
neoplastic O
lesions O
, O
current O
PDAC B-disease
screening O
is O
expensive O
and O
invasive O
and O
is O
likely O
only O
to O
be O
beneficial O
in O
those O
who O
are O
truly O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
PDAC B-disease
. O

Further O
study O
of O
PDAC B-disease
prevention O
and O
screening O
based O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
germline O
genetic O
mutation O
is O
warranted O
and O
ongoing O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
we O
show O
an O
increased O
prevalence O
of O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
an O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
surgical O
cohort O
of O
patients B-species
with O
PDAC B-disease

We O
furthermore O

the O

of O

Management O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease

with O
a O
BRCA B-gene

should O
be O
established O
based O
on O
the O
clinicopathologic O
status O
as O
well O
as O
the O
result O
of O

. O

Both O
prophylactic O
mastectomy O
and O
prophylactic O

are O
performed O
in O
approximately O
one-third O
and O
one O
half O
of O
mutation O
carriers O
in O
Western O
countries O
, O
respectively O
. O

However O
, O
decision-making O

done O
by O
a O
physician O

about O
the O

There O
are O
some O
limitations O
to O
applying O
the O
clinical O
practice O
guidelines O
for O
genetic O
testing O
based O
on O
data O
from O
Western O
countries O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O

data O
in O

of O
Korean O
and O
other O
racial O
backgrounds O
. O

First O
, O
the O
clinicopathological O
features O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
may O
differ O
between O
races O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
proportion O
of O
triple B-disease
negative I-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
higher O
in O
African-Americans B-species
and O
Asians B-species
compared O
to O
Caucasian B-species
Americans B-species
. O

Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
Asian O
countries O
, O
such O
as O
Korea O
, O
is O
lower O
than O
in O
Europe O
and O
the O
US O
, O
the O
incidence O
of O
Korean O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
has O
increased O
continuously O
by O
about O
threefold O
during O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
. O

The O
most O
striking O
difference O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
Western O
countries O
is O
that O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
Korean O
women B-species
develops O
at O
a O
younger O
age O
. O

Sixty O
percent O
of O
patients B-species
in O
Korea O
are O
premenopausal O
compared O
to O
30 O
% O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

As O
ER-negative O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
are O
more O
common O
in O
premenopausal O
women B-species
, O
one O
may O
expect O
differences O
in O
frequencies O
of O
molecular O
subtypes O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
between O
Korean O
and O
Caucasian O
women B-species
. O

There O
may O
be O
differences O
between O
countries O
in O
terms O
of O
genetic-environment O
interaction O
for O
development O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
ethnic O
diet O
, O
or O
environmental O
exposures O
. O

Consideration O
of O
family O
structure O
between O
in O
Korea O
and O
in O
Western O
countries O
is O
also O
needed O
because O
smaller O
family O
size O
makes O
family O
history O
less O
useful O
for O
identification O
of O
germline O
genetic O
risk O
. O

Prevalence O

However O
, O
defining O
founder O
genes O
in O
Korean O
breast B-disease

should O
be O
approached O
carefully O
, O
because O
there O
is O
no O
data O
of O

frequency O
in O
the O
Korean O
general O
population O
and O
additional O
data O
about O
BRCA B-gene

is O
required O
even O
though O
the O
KOHBRA O
study O
was O
a O
nationwide O
multicenter O
study O
. O

The O
selection O
of O
genetic O
testing O
criteria O
would O
be O
clinically O
important O
because O
the O
mutation O
result O
might O
affect O
the O
decision-making O
for O
operation O
method O
and O
follow-up O
method O
. O

Although O
widely O
accepted O
clinical O
criteria O
for O
referral O
are O
usually O
suggested O
, O
genetic O
testing O
criteria O
may O
differ O
between O
countries O
based O
on O
mutation O
prevalence O
because O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
varies O
considerably O
among O
ethnic O
groups O
and O
geographical O
areas O
. O

As O
the O
NCCN O
guideline O
currently O
recommends O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
genetic O
testing O
for O
any O
patient B-species
with O
high O

ovarian I-disease

: O
noted O
in O
this O
study O
: O
may O
play O
a O
key O
role O
for O
genetic O

criteria O
in O
Korean O

BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
, O
two O
of O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
computer O
predictive O
models O
on O
clinical O
expertise O
, O
show O
accuracy O
of O
approximately O
80 O
% O
for O
whites O
with O
strong O
personal O
and/or O

history O
of O
breast B-disease
, I-disease
ovarian I-disease
, I-disease
and/or I-disease
male I-disease
breast I-disease

. O

However O
since O
these O
models O
show O
underestimation O
of O
Asian O
mutation O
carriers O
because O
of O
their O
differences O
in O
performance O
by O
race/ethnicity O
, O
using O
these O
models O
to O
predict O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
probability O
among O
Korean O
patients B-species
may O
result O
in O
inaccuracies O
. O

Therefore O
, O
large O
nationwide O
trials O
like O
the O
KOHBRA O
study O
are O
needed O
to O
continue O
developing O
the O
appropriate O
guidelines O
for O

, O
genetic O

, O
and O
management O
as O
well O
as O
the O
suitable O
predictive O
model O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

patients B-species
or O

in O
Korea O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
evaluate O
whether O
the O
difference O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

exists O
between O
Koreans O
and O
other O
races O
. O

Identifying O
racial O
differences O

or O
lifestyle O
factors O
, O
which O
may O
modify O
the O
cancer O
risk O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

, O
is O
also O
a O
priority O
for O
future O
research O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
management O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
patients B-species
or O
carriers O
in O
Korea O
is O
recommending O
that O
application O
is O
individually O
based O
on O
the O
prevalence O
data O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

of O
the O
KOHBRA O
study O
, O
as O
well O
as O

as O
the O
NCCN O

Our O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
despite O
being O
a O
large O
multicenter O
nationwide O
study O
. O

Three O
different O
screening O
methods O
for O
testing O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
performed O
although O
most O
patients B-species
were O
tested O
with O
the O
F-CSGE O
method O
. O

This O
heterogeneous O
screening O
method O
might O
affect O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
number O
of O
patients B-species
varied O
according O
to O
risk O
groups O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
as O
well O
as O
in O
patients B-species
with O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
this O
study O
must O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution O
due O
to O
the O
very O
small O
number O
of O
subjects O
. O

Another O
limitation O
involves O
the O
various O
additional O
primary O
organ O
sites O
for O
patients B-species
with O
multiple O
organ O
cancers O
. O

Additional O
primary O
cancer O
sites O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
in O
our O
study O
were O
thyroid O
, O
uterus O
, O
kidney O
, O
stomach O
, O
tongue O
, O
rectum O
, O
liver O
, O
bone O
, O
and O

. O

Whether O
cancers O
from O
these O
organs O
are O
genetically O
related O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
requires O
confirmation O
. O

Besides O
the O
differences O
in O
number O
of O
cases O
with O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
history O
, O
the O
different O
sites O
of O
multiple-organ O
cancers O
might O
affect O
the O
many O
discrepancies O
in O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
in O
multiple O
organ O
cancers O
cases O
between O
our O
study O
and O
the O
previous O
smaller O
study O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
detected O
at O
higher O
frequency O
than O
reported O
for O
Korean O
sporadic B-disease

in O
those O
patients B-species

no O

but O
with O
other O

In O
particular O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
high-risk O
patients B-species

DCIS B-disease
are O
appropriate O
candidates O
for O
genetic O

for O
BRCA B-gene

Introduction O
Ductal B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in I-disease
situ I-disease
( O
DCIS B-disease
) O
is O
the O
fourth O
leading O
cause O
of O
cancer O
among O
women B-species
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

Between O
1980 O
and O
2001 O
, O
age-adjusted O
rates O
of O
DCIS B-disease
increased O
7.2-fold O
, O
likely O
because O
of O
the O
widespread O
use O
of O
screening O
mammography O
. O

DCIS B-disease
is O
not O
immediately O
life-threatening O
, O
but O
it O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
invasive B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
IBC B-disease
) O
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
14 O
% O
to O
50 O
% O
of O
DCIS B-disease
lesions O
will O
progress O
to O
IBC B-disease
if O
left O
untreated O
. O

The O
identification O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer-susceptibility O
genes O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
has O
important O
implications O
for O
carriers O
in O
general O
, O
because O
they O
are O
the O
principal O
cause O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
syndrome I-disease
( O
HBOC B-disease
) O
. O

Women B-species
who O
carry O
a O
germ O
line O
mutation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
a O
43 O
% O
to O
84 O
% O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
BC B-disease
) O
and O
a O
22 O
% O
to O
39 O
% O
risk O
of O
developing O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O

) O
by O
age O
70 O
years O
. O

The O
association O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
with O
IBC B-disease
is O
well O
established O
; O
however O
, O
to O
date O
, O
there O
is O
no O
consensus O
on O
whether O
or O
not O
DCIS B-disease
is O
part O
of O
the O
BRCA-associated O
hereditary B-disease
breast-ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
spectrum O
. O

Although O
early O
studies O
revealed O
a O
lower O
prevalence O
of O
DCIS B-disease
associated O
with O
IBC B-disease
in O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutation O
carriers O
, O
the O
subsequent O
identification O
of O
DCIS B-disease
in O
prophylactic O
mastectomy O
specimens O
from O
carriers O
led O
investigators O
to O
reconsider O
DCIS B-disease
as O
a O
component O
of O
HBOC B-disease
. O

Although O
2 O
studies O
have O
reported O
a O
similar O
incidence O
of O
DCIS B-disease
in O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1/BRCA2-positive O
tumors O
compared O
with O
BRCA-negative O
tumors O
, O
Kauff O
et O
al O
observed O
that O
preinvasive O
lesions O
actually O
were O
more O
common O
in O
prophylactic O
mastectomy O
tissue O
specimens O
from O
carriers O
than O
in O
breast O
tissue O
obtained O
at O
autopsy O
from O
unaffected O
women B-species
who O
had O
no O
known O
hereditary O
predisposition O
to O
BC B-disease
. O

A O
few O
retrospective O
studies O
have O
examined O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutations O
in O
women B-species
diagnosed O
with O
DCIS B-disease
and O
have O
reported O
mutation O
rates O
ranging O
between O
3.3 O
% O
and O
13 O
% O
. O

Those O
studies O
support O
the O
concept O
that O
women B-species
with O
DCIS B-disease
, O
like O
their O
counterparts O
with O
IBC B-disease
, O
warrant O
genetic O
risk O
assessment O
and O
testing O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
high-risk O
variables O
. O

Notably O
, O
the O
knowledge O
of O
a O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutation O
is O
likely O
to O
significantly O
change O
the O
assessment O
of O
a O

risks O
for O
future O
cancers O
and O
the O
cancer O

that O
would O
be O

. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
define O
the O
disease O
and O
clinical O
predisposing O
conditions O
for O
mutations O
in O
the O

It O

The O
relatively O

can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
highly O
select O

BRCA B-gene

may O
have O
been O
more O
prevalent O
in O
the O

Alternatively O

In O

the O

be O

the O

In O

however O
the O

lack O

limit O
the O
ability O
to O
reach O
a O
definitive O
conclusion O
. O

The O
likelihood O

often O
is O
calculated O
using O
the O
BRCAPRO O
model O

Yet O
the O
current O
BRCAPRO O
program O
does O
not O
account O
for O
DCIS B-disease
as O
a O
risk O
factor O
in O
the O
likelihood O
of O
detecting O
a O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutation O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
not O
intended O
for O
or O
validated O
in O
the O
DCIS B-disease
population O
, O
our O
study O
supports O
the O
finding O
that O
further O

in O
BRCAPRO O
may O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
used O
in O
this O
setting O
. O

Conversely O
, O
our O
findings O
also O
suggest O
that O
the O
BRCAPRO O

may O
underestimate O
the O
relative O
contribution O
DCIS B-disease
had O
on O
the O
likelihood O
of O
detecting O
a O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutation O
, O
because O
the O

only O
54 O
% O

the O

that O

actually O
identified O
in O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
, O
in O
patients B-species
whose O
calculated O
BRCAPRO O

< O
10 O
% O
, O
the O
rate O
of O

was O
as O
high O

18 O
% O
; O
therefore O
, O
prospective O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O

the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
current O

Despite O
the O
similarities O

our O

For O

The O

these O

Will O

? O

In O
Western O
countries O
, O
the O
mutation O
status O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
is O
commonly O
determined O
for O
genetic O
counseling O
among O
members O
of O

with O
a O

or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
especially O
for O
women B-species
of O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
ethnicity O
. O

Recent O
studies O
in O
the O
Cancer O
Genome O

have O
demonstrated O
that O

are O
more O

Thus O
, O
in O
Western O
countries O
, O
the O

is O
recognized O

the O

, O
all O

Patients B-species

stratified O

We O
observed O
that O
patients B-species

were O
younger O
at O

( O

BRCA2 B-gene

were O
associated O
with O

PFS O
and O
an O
increased O
rate O
of O

to O
primary O
platinum O

, O
whereas O
the O
outcomes O
of O
BRCA1-mutated O
or O
BRCA1-methylated O
cases O
were O
not O
statistically O
different O
from O
those O
of O

Mechanistically O
, O
BRCA2-mutated O
but O
not O
the O
BRCA1-mutated O

exhibited O
a O

containing O
significantly O
more O

wild-type O
BRCA B-gene

This O
is O
the O
first O
detailed O
analysis O
on O
the O

relationship O
of O

BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
with O
genomic O

in O
Ovarian B-disease

The O
results O
suggest O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
may O
underlie O
marked O
genomic O
instability O
resulting O
in O
extensive O
gene O
mutations O
in O
the O

, O
and O
this O
instability O
may O
also O
be O
responsible O
for O

chemotherapies O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
are O
two O
major O
notable O
clinical O
differences O
between O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRGA2-related O
ovarian B-disease

: O
the O

and O
chemosensitivity/survival O
. O

In O
most O

, O
BRCA1-mutated O
Ovarian B-disease

are O

approximately O
5 O

( O

, O
respectively O
) O
. O

By O
multivariate O
analysis O
in O
our O

Implications O
for O
the O
Management O
of O
BRCA-related O
Ovarian B-disease

Recommendations O
Because O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
status O
is O
associated O

survival O
and O

, O
there O
could O
be O
several O
implications O
for O
ovarian B-disease

management O
. O

BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
status O
could O
be O
used O
as O
a O
genetic O
marker O
for O
prognosis O
. O

Clinicians O
could O
set O
better O
expectations O
for O
patients B-species
, O
including O
education O
on O
the O
benefit O
of O
chemotherapy O
and O
more O
active O
confrontation O
of O
the O
disease O
to O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
as O
BRCA2-mutant O
cells O
are O
more O
sensitive O
to O
platinum-based O
schedules O
, O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
associated O
with O
longer O
platinum-free O
duration O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
and O
wild-type O
BRCA B-gene
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
this O
knowledge O
could O
influence O
chemotherapeutic O
choices O
in O
the O
recurrent O
setting O
as O
well O
with O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
drugs O
. O

This O
new O
generation O
of O
drugs O
includes O
poly O
( O
ADP-ribose O
) O
polymerase O
( O
PARP O
) O
inhibitors O
, O
which O
have O
demonstrated O
cytotoxic O
effects O
on O
BRCA1-deficient O
or O
BRCA2-deficient O
cells O
, O
a O
phenomenon O
called O
synthetic O
lethality O
. O

Promising O
results O

in O
BRCA-associated O
carcinomas O
( O

Future O
analysis O
will O
determine O
whether O
BRCA2-mutated O
cases O
are O
more O
sensitive O
to O
PARP O

. O

Unfortunately O
, O
because O
the O

Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
whether O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
founder O
mutations O
differ O
between O
southern O
and O
northern O
Chinese O
populations O
. O

It O
is O
not O
entirely O
impossible O
for O
such O
a O
difference O
to O
exist O
given O
that O
Cantonese-speaking O
southern O
Chinese O
have O
a O
significantly O
increased O
risk O
in O
developing O

. O

Regardless O
, O
we O
believe O
it O
is O
worthwhile O
for O
Chinese O
researchers O
to O
carry O
out O
comprehensive O
analysis O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
among O
Chinese O

to O
determine O
whether O

clinically O
important O
. O

Because O
the O
techniques O
for O
measuring O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
standard O
and O
relatively O
inexpensive O
, O
the O

Implications O

these O

will O
likely O

METHODS O
: O

Patients B-species

RESULTS O
: O
Overall O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
for O
patients B-species
who O
meet O
specified O
personal O
and O

cancer O
history O
criteria O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
consist O
of O
single O
base O
changes O
or O
deletions/insertions O
of O
small O
numbers O
of O
bases O
that O
result O
in O
protein O
truncation O
, O
disruption O
of O
messenger O
RNA O
processing O
, O
or O
amino O
acid O
substitutions O
that O
have O
significant O

on O

. O

These O

are O
readily O

methods O
for O
Sanger O
DNA O

of O

. O

A O
minority O
of O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
genes O
are O
large O
rearrangements O
( O
LRs O
) O
of O
DNA O
segments O
that O
disrupt O
gene O
function O
. O

These O
primarily O
consist O
of O
deletions O
and O
duplications O
of O
1 O
or O
more O
exons O
. O

These O
LRs O
are O
mostly O
refractory O
to O
detection O
by O
PCR-based O
sequencing O
, O
requiring O
alternative O
assays O
such O
as O
Southern O

, O
multiplex O
ligation-dependent O
probe O
amplification O
, O
quantitative O
PCR O
, O
or O
comparative O
genomic O

Recently O
, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
massively O
parallel O
sequencing O
technologies O
have O
the O
capability O
to O
detect O
LRs O
along O
with O
sequencing O
mutations O
, O
without O
requiring O
additional O
assays O
. O

However O
, O
adapting O
next-generation O
sequencing O
platforms O
to O
optimize O
detection O
of O
LRs O
may O
still O
require O
additional O
laboratory O
and O
informatics O
resources O
beyond O
those O
required O
to O
determine O
the O
sequence O
data O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
standards O
and O
guidelines O
for O
LR O
testing O
using O
massively O
parallel O
sequencing O
platforms O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
established O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting O
. O

Because O
the O
detection O
of O
LRs O
requires O
resources O
beyond O
those O
required O
for O
standard O
sequence O
analysis O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
establish O
the O
relative O
prevalence O
of O
this O
type O
of O
mutation O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
to O
inform O
decisions O
about O
LR O
testing O
for O
individual O
patients B-species
. O

In O
a O
broader O
sense O
, O
this O
data O
can O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
consensus O
regarding O
whether O
LR O
testing O
should O
be O
routinely O
included O
as O
a O
component O
of O
clinical O
testing O
for O
all O
patients B-species
at O
risk O
for O
HBOC B-disease
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
studies O
reporting O
on O
the O
detection O
of O
LRs O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
have O
focused O
on O
relatively O
small O
numbers O
of O
individuals O
of O
specific O
ancestries O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
some O
studies O
have O
targeted O
LR O
testing O
to O
very O
high-risk O
patients B-species
already O
known O
to O
be O
negative O
for O
mutations O
detected O
with O
sequencing O
, O
without O
providing O
prevalence O
estimates O
of O
sequencing O
versus O
LR O
mutations O
overall O
. O

Estimates O
of O
the O
percentage O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
that O
are O
LRs O
have O
ranged O
from O
0 O
% O
to O
40 O
% O
. O

Our O
laboratory O
first O
began O
limited O
LR O
testing O
in O
August O
2002 O
, O
using O
a O
5-site O
Large O

Panel O
( O

) O
of O
targeted O
PCR O
reactions O
to O
detect O
5 O
recurrent O
LRs O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
that O
had O
been O
observed O
primarily O
in O
European O
populations O
. O

We O
subsequently O
developed O
an O
additional O
technology O
for O
comprehensive O
detection O
of O
LRs O
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

The O
BRACAnalysis O

Test O
( O
BART O
) O
is O
a O
quantitative O

PCR O

that O
detects O
all O
large O

across O
the O

regions O
and O

of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O

. O

This O
clinical O
test O
has O
been O
available O
since O
August O
2006 O
, O
wherein O
BART O
testing O
has O
been O
performed O

for O
patients B-species
meeting O
criteria O
indicating O
a O
high O
probability O
of O

a O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

. O

BART O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
for O
patients B-species
who O
do O
not O

criteria O
, O
but O
for O
whom O
the O

on O
an O

. O

As O
of O
December O
1 O
, O
2011 O
, O
our O
laboratory O
has O
performed O
comprehensive O
LR O
testing O
as O
a O

service O
for O
more O
than O
64,000 O

to O
analyze O

sets O
an O

larger O
than O
those O
of O
any O

. O

Furthermore O
, O
this O
referral O

is O
drawn O
primarily O
from O
the O

. O

Here O
, O
we O
characterize O
the O

this O

LR O
Mutations O
Among O
the O
48,456 O

included O
in O
this O

LRs O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
27 O
LRs O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene

. O

These O
mutations O
range O
from O
deletion O
or O
duplication O
of O
a O
single O
exon O
to O
whole-gene O
deletions O
of O
either O

DISCUSSION O
This O

the O
largest O

comparing O
the O
outcomes O
of O
clinical O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
analysis O
, O
using O
both O
Sanger O
sequencing O
and O
an O
assay O
for O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
most O
previous O
studies O
, O
our O
cohort O
is O
representative O
of O
the O
patient B-species
population O
currently O
targeted O
for O
clinical O
testing O
in O
the O
United O
States O
, O
comprising O
patients B-species
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
probabilities O
of O
carrying O
a O
mutation O
, O
and O
inclusive O
of O
diverse O
ancestries O
. O

This O
data O
provides O
a O
framework O
for O
assessing O
the O
overall O
importance O
of O
LRs O
for O
clinical O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
analysis O
. O

Among O
25,535 O
patients B-species
meeting O
higher-risk O
criteria O
, O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
detected O
in O
approximately O
23.8 O
% O
of O
patients B-species
, O
versus O
8.2 O
% O
in O
the O
22,921 O
elective O
group O
of O
patients B-species
. O

These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
the O
high-risk O
clinical O
history O
criteria O
were O
effective O
in O
identifying O
patients B-species
with O
higher O
mutation O
probabilities O
. O

LRs O
made O
up O
9.9 O
% O
of O
all O
mutations O
in O
high-risk O
patients B-species
, O
breaking O
down O
to O
14.0 O
% O
of O
all O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
and O
2.6 O
% O
of O
all O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

In O
patients B-species
who O
had O
BART O
as O
an O
elective O
test O
, O
LRs O
made O
up O
5.9 O
% O
of O
all O
mutations O
, O
breaking O
down O
to O
11.8 O
% O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
1.2 O
% O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

These O
LR O
prevalence O
rates O
are O
within O
the O
wide O
ranges O
reported O
in O
previous O
studies O
for O
patients B-species
of O
various O
nationalities O
. O

We O
found O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
LRs O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
compared O
to O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
confirming O
previous O
reports O
. O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
abundance O
of O
Alu O
repeats O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
wherein O
Alu O
sequences O
create O
`` O
hotspots O
'' O
for O
unequal O
homologous O
recombination O
, O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
LRs O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
our O
current O
data O
underestimates O
LRs O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

Because O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
less O
penetrant O
than O
those O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
may O
be O
under-referred O
for O
testing O
due O
to O
less O
striking O
clinical O
histories O
. O

The O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
LR O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
versus O
BRCA2 B-gene
partially O
explains O
the O
significantly O
increased O
proportion O
of O
LR O
mutations O
in O
the O
high-risk O
versus O
elective O
patients B-species
( O
9.9 O
% O
vs O
5.9 O
% O
) O
. O

Patients B-species
with O
more O
severe O
personal O
and O
family O
histories O
tend O
to O
carry O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
compared O
with O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
consistent O
with O
the O
increased O
penetrance O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

However O
, O
we O
can O
not O
rule O
out O
other O
contributing O
factors O
, O
such O
as O
potentially O
higher O
penetrance O
for O
some O
LR O
mutations O
. O

Notably O
, O
the O
percentage O
of O
all O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
that O
involved O
LRs O
was O
double O
in O
high-risk O
patients B-species
compared O
to O
elective O
BART O
patients B-species
, O
2.6 O
% O
versus O
1.0 O
% O
( O
P O
= O
.004 O
) O
. O

This O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
LR O
mutations O
could O
be O
more O
penetrant O
than O
BRCA2 B-gene
sequencing O
mutations O
. O

A O
smaller O
difference O
was O
observed O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
LRs O
, O
14.0 O
% O
versus O
11.8 O

, O
which O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
patient B-species
ancestry O
is O
most O
dramatically O
illustrated O
by O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
LR O
in O
patients B-species
of O
Latin O
American/Caribbean O
ancestry O
, O
which O
is O
approximately O
2-fold O
higher O
than O
the O

An O

higher O
proportion O
of O
LRs O
among O

not O
statistically O
significant O
due O
to O
small O
sample O

. O

Our O

indicates O
that O
a O
number O
of O
LRs O
involving O
the O

exonic O
regions O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene

Latin O
American/Caribbean O
population O
overall O
. O

Our O
laboratory O
first O
began O
testing O
for O
LRs O
, O
using O
the O
LRP O
assay O
, O
which O
is O
a O
set O
of O
PCR O
reactions O
designed O
to O
detect O
5 O
LRs O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
that O
had O
been O
previously O
identified O
in O
the O
literature O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
almost O
all O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
testing O
had O
been O
performed O
in O
patients B-species
of O
European O
descent O
, O
so O
it O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
the O
LRP O
has O
a O
much O
higher O
sensitivity O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
LRs O
in O
patients B-species
of O
European O
descent O
than O
in O
those O
of O
other O
ancestries O
. O

In O
patients B-species
of O
Western/Northern O
European O
ancestry O
, O
the O
LRP O
detects O
approximately O
one-third O
of O
all O
LRs O
versus O
one-fourth O
in O
our O
total O
testing O
population O
, O
which O
remains O
biased O
toward O
patients B-species
of O
European O
ancestry O
. O

Notably O
, O
the O
LRP O
detected O
only O
3 O
of O
182 O
total O
LRs O
detected O
in O
all O
patients B-species
of O
non-European O
ancestries O
combined O
. O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
current O
LRP O
is O
an O
inadequate O
substitute O
for O
comprehensive O
LR O
testing O
and O
illustrate O
the O
pitfalls O
associated O
with O
designing O
genetic O
assays O
based O
on O
data O
from O
patients B-species
of O
insufficiently O
diverse O
ancestries O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
LRs O
comprise O
a O
significant O
fraction O
, O
between O
6 O
% O
and O
10 O
% O
, O
of O
all O
clinically O
significant O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

We O
have O
also O
documented O
considerable O
variation O
in O
the O
prevalence O
and O
profile O
of O
LR O
based O
on O
patient B-species
ancestry O
. O

These O
observations O
demonstrate O
the O
challenges O
associated O
with O
selectively O
triaging O
LR O
testing O
to O
subsets O
of O
patients B-species
, O
especially O
considering O
that O
we O
still O
have O
limited O
data O
available O
for O
patients B-species
of O
many O
non-European O
ancestries O
. O

With O
this O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
is O
appropriate O
to O
consider O
the O
routine O
inclusion O
of O
assays O
for O
the O
comprehensive O
detection O
of O
LRs O
as O
part O

BRCA1 B-gene

testing O
for O
all O

As O

Introduction O
Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
a O
disease O
in O
which O
breast O
cells O
become O
abnormal O
and O
multiply O
to O
form O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
. O

Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
form O
of O
cancer O
and O
the O
second O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
death O
from O
a O
neoplastic O
disease O
affecting O
women B-species
. O

One O
in O
8 O
women B-species
will O
develop O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
her O
lifetime O
in O
the O
developed O
world O
. O

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
recognized O
risk O
factors O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
development O
including O
hormonal O
, O
reproductive O
, O
and O
menstrual O
history O
, O
age O
, O
lack O
of O
exercise O
, O
alcohol O
, O
radiation O
, O
benign O
breast O
disease O
, O
and O
obesity B-disease
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
key O
factor O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
development O
is O
the O
early O
onset O
of O
disease O
. O

Individual O
risk O
increases O
proportionally O
with O
affected O
relatives O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
early O
age O
of O
onset O
. O

Although O
approximately O
10 O
% O
-30 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
are O
attributed O
to O
hereditary O
factors O
, O
only O
5 O
% O
-10 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
are O
identified O
with O
a O
strong O
inherited O
component O
, O
while O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
these O
cases O
( O
4 O
% O
-5 O
% O
) O
is O
explained O
by O
mutations O
in O
high O
penetrant O
genes O
transmitted O
in O
an O
autosomal O
dominant O
manner O
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
mutated O
genes O
, O
but O
additional O
genes O
associated O
with O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
emerging O
. O

New O
advances O
in O
genomic O
technologies O
have O
led O
to O
parallel O
testing O
of O
multiple O
genes O
. O

Customized O

, O
from O

to O

. O

Nonetheless O
, O
some O
of O
these O
genes O
have O
also O
been O
associated O
with O
increased O

Introduction O
Women B-species
who O
carry O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
( O

genes O
have O
a O
substantially O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
as O
compared O
with O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Estimates O

the O
age-specific O
risk O

to O
mutations O
at O
these O
loci O
vary O

on O
the O
ascertainment O
scheme O

The O
cumulative O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease

by O
age O
70 O
years O
have O
been O

between O
40 O
% O
and O
87 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene

Among O

there O
is O
considerable O
variability O
in O
both O
age O

incidence O

ovarian I-disease

, O
even O
among O

carry O
the O

These O
observations O
of O
large O
variation O

are O
consistent O
with O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
breast B-disease

modified O

other O
genetic O

PIK3CB O
is O
a O
110-kDa O

PI3K O

PIK3CB O
may O
be O
particularly O
relevant O
to O

was O

Although O
this O
study O
provides O
an O
important O
continued O
step O
in O
identifying O
potential O
genetic O
modifiers O
of O
risk O
among O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
there O
are O
some O
limitations O
. O

First O
, O
the O
sample O
size O
was O
limited O
, O
particularly O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
so O
that O
there O
may O
be O
associations O
that O
we O
could O
not O
detect O
and O
the O
point O
estimates O
for O
the O
associations O
we O
did O
detect O
may O
be O
imprecise O
, O
particularly O
for O
SNPs O
and O
haplotypes O
of O
low O
frequency O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
loci O
that O
we O
identified O
in O
this O
study O
that O
had O
significant O
HRs O
for O
risk O
were O
not O
previously O
identified O
as O
the O
top O
candidates O
in O
the O
genome-wide O
association O
study O
( O
GWAS O
) O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
even O
known O
associations O
can O
be O
missed O
in O
GWAS O
, O
as O
only O
the O
top O
hits O
are O
further O
investigated O
through O
replication O
and O
imputation O
of O
additional O
SNPs O
in O
those O
regions O
. O

One O
example O
is O
the O
previous O
finding O
that O
a O
promoter O
SNP O
in O
RAD51C B-gene
is O
a O
modifier O
of O
risk O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
with O
an O
HR O
of O
3.2 O
among O
the O
rare O
homozygotes O
, O
yet O
it O
was O
not O
identified O
in O
the O
GWAS O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
one O
or O
more O
of O
the O
associations O
identified O
here O
were O
missed O
in O
the O
GWAS O
. O

Third O
, O
although O
the O
IGF O
pathway O
was O
a O
priori O
hypothesized O
as O
a O
source O
for O
potential O
modifiers O
, O
multiple O
LD O
blocks O
were O
considered O
for O
association O
testing O
and O
such O
testing O
could O
lead O
to O
inflation O
of O
the O
overall O
type O
I O
error O
rate O
for O
the O
study O
. O

With O
this O
being O
said O
, O
we O
studied O
only O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
of O
the O
genes O
in O
IGF O
signaling O
that O
we O
a O
priori O
deemed O
would O
potentially O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
time O
to O
diagnosis O
and O
considered O
significant O
only O
those O
associations O
that O
decreased O
beyond O
a O
multiple O
comparison-adjusted O
critical O
value O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
view O
the O
goal O
of O
the O
current O
research O
as O
hypothesis O
refinement O
where O
, O
based O
upon O
the O
results O
from O
this O
well-defined O
set O
of O
genes O
, O
we O
will O
further O
validate O
the O
results O
using O
an O
independent O
sample O
. O

As O
with O
all O
observational O
studies O
, O
there O
is O
the O
potential O
for O
selection O
bias O
and O
unmeasured O
confounding O
. O

However O
, O
we O
have O
adjusted O
for O
those O
factors O
that O
are O
most O
likely O
to O
influence O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
within O
this O
cohort O
, O
thus O
lowering O
the O
potential O
for O
unadjusted O
confounding O
. O

We O
and O
others O
have O
investigated O
putative O
risk O
factors O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
published O
studies O
have O
implicated O
loci O
as O
modifiers O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
penetrance O
in O
women B-species
who O
carry O
germline O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
modifiers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
cancer O
risk O
identified O
to O
date O
have O
been O
genetic O
variants O
in O
proteins O
that O
interact O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
in O
DNA O
repair O
. O

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
IGF O
signaling O
also O
modifies O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
penetrance O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

IGF O
signaling O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
directly O
interact O
with O
multiple O
lines O
of O
evidence O
, O
including O
that O
IGF-1 O
enhances O
BRCA1 O
activity O
, O
BRCA1 O
regulates O
IGF1R O
and O
IRS1 O
activity O
, O
and O
BRCA1 O
protein O
expression O
and O
localization O
are O
dependent O
on O
AKT O
activation O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
this O
is O
the O
second O
study O
to O
investigate O
the O
role O
of O
genetic O
variation O
in O
IGF O
signaling O
and O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
women B-species
carrying O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

In O
the O
previous O
study O
, O
we O
identified O
significant O
associations O
in O
variants O
in O
IGF1R B-gene
and O
IRS1 B-gene
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
and O
in O
IGF1R B-gene
, O
IGFBP2 B-gene
, O
and O
IGFBP5 B-gene
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
those O
results O
, O
and O
given O
the O
known O
interaction O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
IGF O
signaling O
, O
we O
investigated O
additional O
variants O
in O
genes O
in O
this O
pathway O
and O
identified O
significant O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
modifiers O
with O
haplotypes O
in O
IGF2 B-gene
for O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
and O
in O
HTRA1 B-gene
and O
MMP3 B-gene
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
respectively O
. O

The O
identification O
of O
causal O
mechanisms O
within O
these O
loci O
is O
needed O
to O
validate O
and O
better O
understand O
these O
associations O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
with O
further O
identification O
of O
genetic O
factors O
that O
modulate O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
and O
overall O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease

, O
and O
better O
elucidation O
of O
the O
actual O

modifying O

, O
these O

can O

Introduction O
Ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
death O
from O
gynecologic O
malignancies O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
is O
the O
fourth O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
cancer O
death O
in O
women B-species
. O

An O
estimated O
21,000 O
cases O
are O
diagnosed O
in O
the O
United O
States O
each O
year O
, O
resulting O
in O
15,000 O
deaths O
. O

It O
is O
now O
recognized O
that O
approximately O
10 O
% O
of O
unselected O
cases O
, O
and O
16-21 O
% O
of O
the O
high-grade O
serous O
subtype O
, O
are O
due O
to O
a O
hereditary O
susceptibility O
, O
of O
which O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
. O

Although O
BRCA1 B-gene

are O
both O
implicated O
in O
the O
development O
of O
hereditary B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
each O
represents O
a O
clinically O

entity O
in O
several O
important O
ways O

The O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene

The O
distinct O
underlying O
biology O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene

has O
also O

Despite O
these O
clear O
biological O
and O

differences O
, O
investigators O
typically O

BRCA1 B-gene

Discussion O
Our O

suggest O
that O
BRCA2-associated O
serous B-disease

may O
have O
meaningfully O
different O
outcomes O
from O
not O
only O
BRCA-negative O
, O
but O
also O
BRCA1-associated O
, O
high-grade O
serous B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
finding O
, O
if O
confirmed O
, O
will O
have O
an O
important O
impact O
on O
clinical O
trial O
design O
given O

, O
many O
of O
which O
will O
specifically O
enrich O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
may O
be O
at O
particular O
risk O
for O
confounded O
results O
if O
stratification O
of O
these O
two O
groups O
is O
not O
considered O
. O

Our O
analysis O
has O
several O
strengths O
. O

Unlike O
several O
other O
survival O
analyses O
of O
BRCA B-gene
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
we O
restricted O
our O
analysis O
to O
only O
advanced O
stage O
( O
III/IV O
) O
, O
high-grade O
serous O
tumors O
, O
the O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
subtype O
that O
accounts O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
related O
to O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

We O
also O
chose O
to O
limit O
or O
cohort O
to O
patients B-species
seen O
at O
our O
institution O
at O
the O
time O
of O
diagnosis O
because O
the O
likelihood O
of O
recurrence O
following O
initial O
therapy O
could O
be O
linked O
to O
BRCA B-gene
status O
. O

The O
patients B-species
presented O
here O
were O
also O
treated O
almost O
exclusively O
during O
a O
15-year O
period O
at O
a O
single O
institution O
with O
common O
surgical O
and O
medical O
standards O
over O
this O
period O
of O
time O
, O
minimizing O
the O
possibility O
that O
our O
analysis O
was O
confounded O
by O
subtle O
differences O
in O
surgical O
or O
chemotherapeutic O
management O
styles O
across O
institutions O
or O
time O
. O

Our O
analysis O
was O
also O
limited O
to O
patients B-species
tested O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
within O
2-years O
of O
initial O
diagnosis O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
restriction O
, O
which O
caused O
us O
to O
remove O
43 O
patients B-species
from O
analysis O
, O
eliminated O
patients B-species
who O
may O
have O
been O
BRCA B-gene
tested O
due O
to O
unexpected O
longevity O
or O
persistent O
sensitivity O
to O
chemotherapy O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
control O
( O
BRCA- O
) O
patients B-species
in O
our O
analysis O
were O
all O
confirmed O
non-carriers O
rather O
then O
untested O
matched O
controls O
as O
had O
been O
the O
case O
in O
some O
previously O
published O
reports O
. O

This O
analysis O
does O
have O
several O
limitations O
. O

Our O
findings O
are O
based O
on O
a O
convenience O
sample O
of O
patients B-species
tested O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

During O
the O
time O
period O
included O
in O
this O
report O
, O
our O
institution O
treated O
approximately O
1200 O
unique O
cases O
of O
newly O
diagnosed O
and O
recurrent O
Stage O
III/IV O
high-grade O
serous B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
meaning O
only O
approximately O
15 O
% O
of O
potential O
cases O
were O
captured O
for O
our O
analysis O
. O

This O
relatively O
low O
capture O
rate O
reflects O
several O
factors O
including O
the O
lack O
of O
universal O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
testing O
and O
the O
use O
of O
strict O
inclusion O
and O
exclusion O
criteria O
designed O
to O
minimize O
bias O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
only O
patients B-species
tested O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
on O
one O
of O
two O
IRB O
approved O
follow-up O
protocols O
were O
included O
due O
to O
unique O
human B-species
subjects O
issues O
and O
privacy O
concerns O
related O
to O
germline O
genetic O
testing O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
speculate O
how O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
capture O
would O
have O
affected O
our O
results O
. O

Differences O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
BRCA- O
cohorts O
are O
also O
worth O
addressing O
. O

The O
BRCA2 B-gene
cohort O
had O
only O
11.8 O
% O
of O
Stage O
IV O
patients B-species
compared O
to O
23.3 O
% O
and O
23.1 O
% O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA- O
cohorts O
. O

Although O
neither O
difference O
was O
statistically O
significant O
, O
repeat O
analysis O
limited O
to O
Stage O
III O
patients B-species
did O
not O
change O
the O
conclusions O
presented O
here O
( O
data O
not O
shown O
) O
. O

Patients B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
also O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
optimally O
debulked O
and O
receive O
IP-based O
first-line O
chemotherapy O
. O

Because O
IP O
chemotherapy O
has O
traditionally O
been O
restricted O
to O
patients B-species
who O
have O
been O
optimally O
debulked O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
these O
two O
findings O
are O
correlated O
. O

Our O
analysis O
found O
a O
trend O
towards O
improved O
survival O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
patients B-species
compared O
to O
BRCA- O
patients B-species
, O
although O
this O
finding O
did O
not O
reach O
significance O
( O
HR O
.70 O
; O
95 O
% O
CI O
, O
.36-1.38 O
; O
P=.31 O
) O
. O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
other O
published O
data O
. O

In O
the O
large O
multivariate O
analysis O
reported O
by O
Chetrit O
, O

a O

; O

% O
CI O
, O
.63-1.05 O
; O

. O

It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
this O
result O
would O
reach O
statistical O
significance O
in O
an O
even O
larger O
cohort O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
data O
presented O
here O
do O
not O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
reason O
for O
improved O
survival O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
compared O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA- O
patients B-species
. O

The O
relative O
contributions O
of O
improved O
chemotherapy O
sensitivity O
versus O
underlying O
differences O
in O
tumor O
biology O
are O
unclear O
. O

A O
case-controlled O
study O
by O
Tan O
and O
colleagues O
found O
higher O

However O
, O
their O

only O
22 O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
( O
17 O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O

and O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
compare O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
outcomes O
. O

More O
recently O
our O
group O
examined O
predictors O
of O
survival O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
the O
patients B-species
included O
in O
the O
present O
report O
. O

In O
this O
prior O
work O
, O
both O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
and O
platinum O
sensitivity O
were O
independent O
predictors O
of O
survival O
, O
suggesting O
that O
both O
tumor O
biology O
and O
chemotherapy O
sensitivity O
may O
contribute O
to O
prolonged O
survival O
. O

This O
prior O
study O
, O
however O
, O
was O
also O
not O
powered O
to O
look O
at O
differences O
between O
carriers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
might O
result O
in O
different O
tumor O
biology O
are O
poorly O
understood O
and O
require O
further O
research O
. O

Until O
recently O
, O
all O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
have O
been O
managed O
similarly O
regardless O
of O
germline O
BRCA B-gene
status O
. O

Although O
BRCA1/2+ O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
have O
been O
suggested O
to O
have O
a O
more O
favorable O
prognosis O
compared O
to O
BRCA- O

for O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
, O
there O
have O
been O
no O

available O
to O
exploit O
the O
underlying O

has O

However O
, O
the O

may O

Hennessy O

on O

In O
this O

Data O
generated O
by O
The O

that O

that O

In O
this O

we O
pooled O

of O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O

. O

We O
found O
that O
the O
minor O
allele O
of O
CASP8 B-gene
D302H B-mutation
was O
associated O
with O
a O
reduced O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
per-allele O
HR O
, O
0.85 O
; O
95 O

, O
0.76-0.97 O
) O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
but O
not O
for O

. O

Previously O
published O
case-control O
studies O
in O
unselected O

decreased O

the O
CASP8 B-gene

with O
an O
OR O
of O
0.83 O

. O

Thus O
, O
the O
per-allele O
HR O
estimate O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene

in O
our O
study O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O

in O
the O
general O
population O

A O
recent O
paper O
by O
Palanca O
Suela O

reported O
an O
OR O

in O
a O
combined O
analysis O
of O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

This O
is O
partly O
consistent O
with O
our O
finding O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O

but O
not O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
although O
they O
had O
not O
investigated O
the O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene

and O
their O
study O
included O
only O
186 O
BRCA1 B-gene

204 O

The O
finding O
that O
CASP8 B-gene
D302H B-mutation
is O
not O
a O
risk O
modifier O
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene

is O
consistent O
with O
previous O
findings O
for O
other O
SNPs O
, O
which O
also O
showed O
associations O
for O
one O
subgroup O
only O
. O

The O
differential O
association O
patterns O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
subgroups O
might O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
these O

represent O
pathologically O
distinct O
entities O

In O
our O
study O

we O
could O
not O

however O
, O
the O

have O
been O

the O

the O
role O

this O

. O

Recent O
haplotype O
analysis O
of O
the O
CASP8 B-gene
locus O
provided O
evidence O
that O
the O
D302H B-mutation
variant O
is O
not O
the O
functionally O
relevant O
variant O
because O
a O
haplotype O
including O
the O

could O
be O
determined O
that O
conferred O
a O
higher O
risk O

the O

. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
variant O
cosegregates O
with O
one O

even O
several O

This O

the O

although O
the O

the O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
lack O
of O

the O

is O
not O
clear O

Furthermore O
, O
the O

we O

The O

future O
studies O

Mutations O
in O
the O
two O

genes O
BRCA1 B-gene

are O
associated O

. O

Patients B-species

both O

rarely O
reported O
and O
often O
involve O
Ashkenazi O

Here O
we O
report O
the O
first O
identification O

a O
Danish O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
family O
heterozygote O

Exon O
trapping O
experiments O
and O
reverse O
transcriptase O
( O
RT O
) O
-PCR O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
results O
in O
skipping O
of O
exon O
7 O
, O
thereby O
introducing O
a O
frameshift O

a O
premature O

. O

We O
therefore O
classify O
the O
mutation O
as O
disease O
causing O
. O

Since O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
Arg1699Gln B-mutation

is O
also O
suggested O

disease-causing O

we O

Discussion O
Patients B-species
double O
heterozygote O
for O
pathogenic O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
rarely O
observed O
, O
and O
most O
reports O
involve O
the O
three O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
BRCA1 B-gene

nucleotide O
5382insC B-mutation
and O
BRCA2 B-gene

( O

. O

However O
, O
four O
reports O
describe O
other O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
including O
a O
Dutch O
study O
describing O
two O
patients B-species
with O
a O
Dutch O
BRCA1 B-gene
founder O
mutation O
and O
two O
different O
BRCA2 B-gene
frameshift O
mutations O
, O
an O
Australian O
study O
describing O
one O
patient B-species
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
frameshift O
mutation O
and O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
splice O
site O
mutation O
, O
while O
a O
Korean O
study O
reported O
two O
cases O
of O
double O
heterozygosity O
for O
frameshift O
or O
nonsense O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
Spanish O
family O
with O
a O
pathogenic O
BRCA1 B-gene
Ala1708Glu B-mutation
missense O
mutation O
and O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
frameshift O
mutation O
has O
been O
identified O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
Danish O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
family O
with O
germ-line O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
proband B-species
, O
the O
probands B-species
father O
, O
and O
the O
probands B-species
two O
children B-species
have O
inherited O
both O
mutations O
. O

The O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
changes B-mutation

acid I-mutation
residue I-mutation
argenine I-mutation
on I-mutation
position I-mutation

to I-mutation
a I-mutation
glutamine I-mutation
. O

Arg1699 O
is O
highly O
conserved O
from O
man B-species
to O
plants O
. O

It O
resides O
in O
the O
BRCT O
domain O
of O
BRCA1 O
, O
which O
is O
involved O
in O
protein-protein O
interaction O
( O
reviewed O
in O
) O
. O

Crystal O
structure O
of O
the O
BRCA1 O
BRCT O

has O
shown O
that O
Arg1699 O
participates O
in O
the O
salt O
bridge O
with O
Asp1840 O
and O
Glu1836 O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
Arg1699Gln B-mutation
mutation O
changes O
the O
amino O
acid O
residue O
from O
basic O
to O
polar O
, O
and O
in O

using O
the O
SIFT O

or O
PMut O

all O
regarded O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
Arg1699Gln B-mutation
mutation O
as O
disease-causing O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
have O
only O
observed O
the O
mutation O
in O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
, O
and O
not O
in O
200 O
healthy O

. O

Still O
, O
there O
have O
previously O
been O
inconclusive O
reports O
regarding O
the O
Arg1699Gln B-mutation
. O

Some O
in O
silico O

studies O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
classify O
the O
mutation O
and O
group O
it O
as O
a O
variant O
of O
unknown O
significance O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
other O
studies O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
deleterious O
using O
in O
silico O
analysis O
. O

Functional O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
Arg1699Gln B-mutation
mutation O
reduces O
the O
transcriptional O
activity O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

Moreover O

compared O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
Arg1699 O
: O
has O
been O
observed O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
Arg1699Gln B-mutation
mutation O
appears O
to O
be O
defective O
in O
nuclear O
foci O
formation O
. O

Moreover O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
another O
substitution O
on O
this O
position O
( O
Arg1699Trp B-mutation
) O
is O
considered O
deleterious O
based O
on O
both O
functional O
and O
co-segregation O
studies O
. O

Together O
, O
these O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
Arg1699Gln B-mutation
mutation O
could O
be O
disease-causing O
, O
although O
it O
may O
have O
a O

suggested O
that O
the O

Therefore O
we O
performed O
exon O

RT-PCR O
analysis O
on O

The O

that O

We O
therefore O
classify O
this O

Interestingly O
, O
even O
though O
the O

is O
double O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene

a O

age O
than O
individuals O
with O
single O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O

. O

This O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
other O
studies O
showing O
that O
double O
heterozygosity O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
lead O

In O

we O

cancer I-disease
, O
it O
is O
known O
that O
malignant O
transformation O
involves O
genetic O
and O
epigenetic O
changes O
that O
result O
in O
uncontrolled O
cellular O
proliferation O
and/or O
abnormal O
programmed O
cell O
death O
or O
apoptosis O
. O

These O
cellular O
abnormalities O
, O
i.e O
. O
cancer O
cells O
; O
arise O
through O
accumulation O
of O
mutations O
that O
are O
frequently O
associated O
with O
molecular O
abnormalities O
in O
certain O
types O
of O
genes O
, O
such O
as O
proto-oncogenes O
and O
tumor-suppressor O
genes O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
genetic O
predisposition O
and/or O
exposure O
to O
physical O
, O
chemical O
, O
biological O
or O
environmental O
factors O
. O

These O
mutations O
are O
either O
inherited O
( O
germline O
) O
or O
acquired O
( O
somatic O
) O
. O

Somatic O
mutation O
may O
determine O
the O
phenotype O
of O
a O
particular O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
may O
be O
of O
clinical O
value O
in O
determining O
prognosis O
. O

However O
, O
only O
germline O
mutations O
can O
predetermine O
an O
individual O
's O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Two O
classes O
of O
inherited O
susceptibility O
genes O
are O
considered O
in O
the O
etiology O
of O
breast O
and O
other O
common O
cancers O
. O

First O
: O
Genes O
have O
been O
identified O
that O
confer O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

These O
include O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
TP53 B-gene
. O

Because O
of O
the O
great O
effect O
these O
genes O
have O
on O
cancer O
risk O
, O
one O
hallmark O
of O
these O
genes O
is O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
Mendelian O
autosomal O
dominant O
pattern O
of O
cancer O
. O

These O
genes O
also O
tend O
to O
predispose O
to O
earlier O
onset O
, O
multifocal O
breast B-disease
tumors I-disease
. O

Second O
: O
Variant O
genotypes O
at O
other O
loci O
( O
polygene O
) O
may O
confer O
a O
relatively O
smaller O
degree O
of O
cancer O
risk O
, O
but O
they O
carried O
by O
a O
larger O
proportion O
of O
the O
general O
population O
. O

In O
the O
general O
population O
, O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
usually O
occurs O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
strong O
family O
history O
, O
appears O
unilaterally O
, O
and O
has O
a O
relatively O
late O
( O
often O
postmenopausal O
) O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
. O

The O
discovery O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
genes O
, O
BRCAl B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
has O
led O
to O
an O
explosive O
growth O
in O
cancer O
screening O
for O
population O
at O
risk O
. O

Every O
one O
carries O
these O
genes O
as O
part O
of O
the O
normal O
genetic O
makeup O
. O

Patients B-species
who O
are O
at O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
carry O
mutations O
of O
these O
genes O
. O

Early O
in O
the O
last O
decades O
, O
in O
1990 O
, O
genetic O
studies O
provided O
initial O
evidence O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
some O
families O
is O
linked O
to O
position O
q2i O
of O
chromosome O
17 O
which O
was O
characterized O
by O
autosomal O
dominant O
inheritance O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
at O
17q O
was O
found O
in O
most O
familial B-disease

, O
suggesting O
the O
involvement O
of O
tumor O

( O

. O

In O
1994 O
, O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
gene O
BRCAl B-gene
, O
the O
most O
important O
tumor O

gene O
, O
was O
identified O
by O
positional O
cloning O
. O

This O
gene O
is O
expressed O
in O
numerous O
tissues O
, O
including O
breast O
and O

BRCAl B-gene
gene O
is O
a O
large O
gene O
spread O
over O
approximately O
100 O

is O
composed O
of O
24 O

a O

There O
is O

that O
BRCA1 O

. O

The O
BRCA1 B-gene

In O
1995 O
, O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene

was O
identified O
at O
chromosome O
13qi2-i3 O
. O

BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
is O
even O
larger O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
consists O
of O
27 O

for O
a O
protein O
of O
3418 O
amino O

, O
making O
a O
380 O

. O

BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
has O
no O
obvious O
homology O
to O
any O
known O
gene O
and O
the O
protein O
contains O
no O
well-defined O
functional O

. O

The O
BRCA2 O
protein O
also O
interacts O
with O
RAD51 O
. O

Perhaps O
through O
this O
mutual O
association O
with O
RAD51 B-gene
, O
BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
associate O
with O
each O

Nonetheless O
, O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
appear O
to O
share O
a O
number O
of O
functional O
similarities O
that O
may O
suggest O
why O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
lead O
to O
specific O
hereditary O
predisposition O
to O
breast B-disease

Discussion O
Efforts O
are O
underway O
to O
reduce O
the O
high O
incidence O
and O
mortality O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
which O
can O
be O
achieved O
by O
the O
early O
detection O
of O
women B-species
at O
high O
risk O
. O

Since O
genetic O
predisposition O
is O
the O
strongest O
risk O
factor O
, O
molecular O
testing O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
the O
only O
way O
for O
early O
detection O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

DNA O
testing O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
became O
an O
option O
after O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

Germline O
mutations O
in O
either O
of O
the O
two O
predisposing O
genes O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
account O
for O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Women B-species
with O
either O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
have O
a O
cumulative O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
invasive B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
of O
about O
55-85 O
% O
. O

Generally O
, O
it O
has O
not O
been O
possible O
for O
clinician O
to O
determine O
which O
individual O
in O
a O
high O
risk O
families O
are O
carriers O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

Women B-species
, O
who O
may O
not O
have O
these O
mutations O
, O
may O
have O
undergone O
unnecessary O
intervention O
including O
prophylactic O
surgery O
. O

So O
the O
availability O
of O
the O
BRCA B-gene
analysis O
has O
beneficial O
impact O
on O
the O
care O
and O
counseling O
of O
women B-species
at O
risk O
. O

Analysis O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
makes O
it O
possible O
to O
identify O
predisposing O
mutations O
in O
affected O
persons B-species
and O
determine O
risks O
for O
family O
members O
. O

Once O
a O
mutation O
is O
identified O
in O
affected O
person B-species
, O
asymptomatic O
family O
members O
can O
be O
tested O
for O
this O
only O
mutation O
, O
since O
first O
degree O
relatives O
of O
patients B-species
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
have O
increased O
risk O
for O
early O
onset O
of O
this O
cancer O
. O

All O
the O
studied O
Egyptian O
patients B-species
had O
invasive B-disease
breast I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

From O
them O
, O
39 O
patients B-species
had O
both O
positive O
family O
history O
and O
early O
age O
at O
onset O
and O
a O
sample O
composed O
of O
15 O
( O
25 O
% O
) O
patients B-species
had O
no O
family O
history O
but O
had O
early O
onset O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

The O
occurrence O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
this O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
studied O
patients B-species
, O
with O
early O
onset O
and O
no O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
suggests O
that O
the O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
in O
patients B-species
with O
negative O
family O
history O
is O
an O
important O
indicator O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
pathologic O
mutations O
and O
lends O
support O
to O
the O
screening O
of O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
in O
patients B-species
with O
early O
onset O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

This O
finding O
is O
nearly O
similar O
to O
a O
study O
in O
a O
group O
of O
Czeck O
women B-species
( O
12.9 O
% O
) O
with O
early O
onset O
non-familial O
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
this O
, O
only O
2 O
% O
of O
non-familial O
patients B-species
had O
pathologic O
germline O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and I-gene
2 I-gene
genes O
in O
a O
group O
of O
English O
patients B-species
who O
were O
diagnosed O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
the O
age O
of O
30 O
years O
or O
younger O
. O

So O
the O
absence O
of O
correlation O
between O
family O
history O
and O
the O
genetic O
risk O
attributable O
to O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
could O
reflect O
variation O
in O
family O
structure O
and O
influence O
of O
additional O
modifier O
genes O
. O

Although O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
exhibit O
profound O
allelic O
heterogeneity O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
repeated O
mutations O
have O
reported O
, O
some O
of O
them O
represent O
founder O
mutations O
. O

The O
knowledge O
of O
founder O
mutations O
can O
shorten O
the O
search O
for O
an O
inherited O
disease-associated O
mutation O
. O

So O
, O
in O
geographic O
areas O
where O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
population O
genetics O

not O

for O

of O
the O
public O

impact O
of O

Ethnicity O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
through O
its O
association O
with O
particular O
founder O
mutations O
. O

Founder O
mutations O
in O
populations O
with O
different O
national O
groups O
have O
been O
described O
in O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jews I-species
, O
Icelanders B-species
, O
French B-species
and O
other O
populations O
. O

With O
knowledge O
of O
these O
mutations O
, O
it O
may O
be O
better O
to O
screen O
for O
a O
small O
number O
of O
founder O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
all O
early O
onset O
cancer O
cases O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
attempt O
comprehensive O
mutation O
screening O
for O
the O
minority O
of O
cases O
with O
a O
strong O
family O
history O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
doing O
BRCA B-gene
testing O
in O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
find O
and O
examine O
the O
biodiversity O
of O
a O
mutations O
in O
families O
of O
patients B-species
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
for O
the O
aim O
of O
early O
detection O
of O
presymptomatic O
relatives O
who O
are O
carriers O
for O
mutation O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
identify O
all O
mutations O
in O
these O
large O
genes O
, O
so O
we O
searched O
for O
mutations O
in O
certain O
exons O
of O
BRCA B-gene
1 I-gene
and I-gene
2 I-gene
genes O
. O

These O
exons O
contain O
frequently O
recurring O
mutations O
described O
worldwide O
, O
but O
the O
type O
of O
mutations O
identified O
can O
differ O
considerably O
from O
country O
to O
country O
. O

Only O
few O
mutations O
are O
dispersed O
world O
wide O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
searched O
for O
three O
founder O
mutations O
in O
exons O
2 O
, O
22 O
, O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
, O
and O
9 O
, O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
two O
middle O
regions O
( O
exons O
8 O
and O
13 O
) O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
were O
investigated O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
mutation O
. O

The O
majorities O
of O
mutations O
, O
known O
to O
be O
disease-causing O
, O
consist O
of O
small O
frame O
shift O
deletions O
, O
small O
insertions O
and O
nonsense O
or O
splice O
site O
mutations O
, O
which O
all O
result O
in O
a O
truncated O
protein O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
known O
structure-function O
relationships O
, O
only O
truncating O
mutations O
are O
usable O
for O
medical O
management O
of O
carrier O
individuals O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
four O
truncating O
mutations O
and O
one O
missense O
mutation O
were O
detected O
among O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
studied O
patients B-species
and O
in O
more O
than O
half O
of O
their O
asymptomatic O
first O
degree O
female O
relatives O
. O

The O
truncating O
mutations O
were O
three O
frame O
shift O
mutations O
and O
one O
nonsense O
mutation O
. O

All O
mutations O
were O
repeated O
in O
6 O
or O
more O
families O
. O

The O
recurrent O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
all O
( O
100 O
% O
) O
families O
with O
detected O
mutations O
. O

This O
finding O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
study O
of O
Corski O
et O
al. O
, O
which O
found O
recurrent O
mutations O
in O
93 O
% O
of O
families O
with O
detected O
mutations O
. O

The O
first O
studied O
founder O
mutation O
in O
the O
current O
study O
was O
the O
frame O
shift O
mutation O
185 B-mutation
del I-mutation
AG I-mutation
in O
exon O
2 O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
. O

It O
was O
identified O
in O
10 O
% O
of O
families O
( O
index O
cases O
and O
their O
asymptomatic O
relatives O
) O
. O

This O
mutation O
was O
detected O
with O
high O
frequency O
in O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jews I-species
, O
in O
two O
Spanish O
families O
, O
in O
3 O
of O
4 O
families O
with O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
ancestry O
in O
France O
and O
in O
non-Ashkenazi O
groups O
across O
the O
middle O
east O
, O
Turkey O
, O
England O
, O
Iran O
, O
Asia O
and O
India O
. O

The O
second O
studied O
founder O
mutation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
is O
a O
frame O
shift O
mutation O
in O
exon O
22 O
( O
5454 B-mutation
del I-mutation
C I-mutation
) O
. O

It O
is O
recently O
detected O
in O
16.7 O
% O
Filipino O
patients B-species
and O
their O
asymptomatic O
relatives O
. O

The O
knowledge O
about O
this O
mutation O
is O
limited O
. O

The O
third O
studied O
founder O
mutation O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
is O
the O
frame O
shift O
( O
5-base O
deletion O
) O
mutation O
in O
exon O
9 O
( O
999 B-mutation
del I-mutation
5 I-mutation
) O
. O

This O
mutation O
is O
recurrent O
and O
proposed O
as O
an O
ancient O
founder O
mutation O
. O

It O
has O
been O
identified O
as O
a O
strong O
founder O
in O
Iceland O
. O

Also O
it O
was O
identified O
in O
Finnish O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
, O
which O
may O
reflect O
ancient O
genetic O
relationships O
between O
European O
populations O
. O

Other O
BRCA2 B-gene
founder O
mutations O
in O
other O
exons O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
Filipino O
patients B-species
, O
and O
in O
Jewish O
patients B-species
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
is O
frequently O
repeated O
among O
different O
families O
( O
26.7 O
% O
) O
in O
both O
patients B-species
and O
their O
relatives O
, O
suggesting O
a O
founder O
effect O
in O
our O
population O
. O

The O
presence O
of O
this O
mutation O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
those O
patients B-species
having O
a O
positive O
family O
history O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

Some O
patients B-species
carrying O
this O
mutation O
have O
negative O
family O
history O
. O

Failure O
to O
identify O
family O
history O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
small O
family O
size O
and O
young O
relatives O
. O

For O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
a O
study O
has O
provided O
evidence O
that O
mutation O
in O
a O
~3.3 O
kb O
nucleotide O
region O
of O
exon O
11 O
( O
denoted O
the O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cluster O
region O
, O
OCCR O
) O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
relative O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
suggestion O
that O
mutation O
in O
OCCR O
is O
less O
penetrate O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
younger O
ages O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
, O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
in O
exon O
9 O
is O
outside O
the O
OCCR O
. O

This O
explains O
why O
all O
the O
Egyptian O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
having O
this O
mutation O
are O
of O
young O
age O
, O
less O
than O
forty O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
the O
identified O
repeated O
mutation O
in O
exon O
13 O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
is O
a O
nonsense O
mutation O
( O
4446 B-mutation
C I-mutation
-- I-mutation
T I-mutation
) O
. O

It O
was O
detected O
in O
20 O
% O
of O
families O
. O

This O
mutation O
was O
found O
frequently O
in O
French-Canadian O
families O
and O
two O
families O
in O
France O
. O

These O
multiple O
instances O
of O
mutation O
did O
not O
represent O
a O
founder O
effect O
many O
generations O
in O
the O
past O
. O

There O
was O
evidence O
for O
multiple O
independent O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutational O
events O
and O
so O
multiple O
origins O
. O

The O
4446 B-mutation
C I-mutation
-- I-mutation
T I-mutation
mutation O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
mutations O
found O
in O
the O
Breast O
Cancer O
Information O
Core O
Data O
base O
. O

These O
mutations O
are O
likely O
to O
have O
arisen O
independently O
owing O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
mutational O
hot O
spots O
in O
the O
coding O
sequence O
of O
the O
gene O
. O

The O
last O
investigated O
exon O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
for O
detection O
of O
mutation O
was O
exon O
8 O
. O

It O
has O
been O
found O
that O
13.3 O
% O
of O
index O
patients B-species
and O
half O
their O
asymptomatic O
relatives O
have O
mutation O
in O
exon O
8 O
( O
738 B-mutation
C I-mutation
-- I-mutation
A I-mutation
) O
. O

This O
mutation O
is O
a O
missense O
mutation O
predicted O
to O
destroy O
the O
protein O
ring-finger O
. O

Hamann O
et O
al O
. O
found O
one O
missense O
mutation O
in O
exon O
8 O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
in O
Germany O
. O

The O
coexistence O
of O
more O
than O
founder O
mutation O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
some O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
families O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
, O
four O
families O
of O
the O
60 O
Egyptian O
families O
were O
found O
to O
have O
inherited O
mutation O
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
, O
they O
are O
double O
heterozygote O
. O

Previous O
studies O
described O
an O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
patient B-species
found O
to O
have O
germline O
mutations O
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
. O

The O
potential O
explanation O
for O
the O
occurrence O
of O
the O
two O
mutations O
occurring O
in O
the O
same O
individual O
is O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
maintenance O
of O
genomic O
integrity O
. O

Collectively O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
and/or O
BRCA B-gene
2 I-gene
mutations O
have O
been O
found O
to O
account O
for O
a O
greater O
proportion O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
among O
the O
studied O
families O
. O

This O
observation O
might O
be O
due O
to O
the O
relatively O
young O
ages O
of O
diagnosis O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
that O
the O
hereditary O
cancers O
occur O
disproportionally O
in O
young O
women B-species
. O

The O
accumulation O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
data O
from O
sets O
of O
families O
revealed O
the O
prevalence O
of O
different O
mutations O
and O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
putative O
recurrent O
founder O
mutations O
in O
Egyptians O
. O

The O
high O
frequency O
of O
any O
recurrent O
mutation O
( O
frame O
shift O
) O
, O
so O
far O
, O
suggest O
that O
there O
may O
be O
a O
strong O
BRCA1 B-gene
and I-gene
2 I-gene
founder O
effects O
in O
Egyptian O
population O
. O

The O
presence O
of O
putative O
founder O
mutations O
, O
which O
leading O
to O
reduce O
genetic O
heterogeneity O
of O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
, O
facilitates O
carrier O
detection O
and O
genetic O
counseling O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
countries O
, O
where O
founder O
mutations O
are O
present O
, O
it O
is O
more O
economical O
to O
screen O
all O
cases O
for O
founder O
mutations O
than O
do O
perform O
a O
complete O
screen O
for O
the O
two O
genes O
on O
a O
subset O
of O
familial O
cases O
. O

Mutations O
analysis O
for O
a O
limited O
set O
of O
founder O
mutations O
requires O
much O
less O
time O
, O
resources O
and O
labor O
than O
complete O
screening O
of O
genes O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
cost O
per O
mutation O
detected O
, O
and O
a O
greater O
number O
of O
mutations O
will O
be O
found O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
, O
eight O
index O
cases O
and O
their O
families O
showed O
negative O
results O
( O
i.e O
. O
no O
detected O
mutation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
) O
. O

This O
can O
be O
explained O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
, O
there O
may O
be O
no O
inherited O
predisposition O
to O
the O
disease O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
failure O
to O
detect O
a O
mutation O
does O
not O
exclude O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
individual O
has O
predisposing O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
as O
we O
did O
not O
screen O
the O
whole O
gene O
. O

These O
families O
, O
in O
whom O
no O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
the O
proband B-species
, O
have O
no O
risk O
of O
passing O
the O
mutation O
to O
their O
off O
spring O
and O
can O
be O
considered O
to O
have O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
general O
population O
, O
if O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
a O

cancer I-disease
gene O
inherited O
from O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
family O
( O
paternal O
side O
) O
. O

It O
is O
appropriate O
to O
offer O
mutation O
analysis O
to O
both O
parents O
of O
an O
individual O
with O
a O
BRCA B-gene
cancer O
predisposing O

In O
our O

four O

of O
the O

, O
and O
they O
might O

for O
BRCA1 B-gene

. O

For O

the O

depends O
on O
the O

The O

if O
their O

The O
risk O

however O
, O
depends O
upon O
variables O
including O
the O
peretrance O
of O
the O

However O
, O
the O
most O

be O
the O
fact O
that O

been O
performed O
in O
a O

therefore O
has O
a O
greater O
power O

it O

show O
that O
in O

the O

Breast B-disease

The O
NCCN O
recommends O
that O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
screening O
for O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-mutation O
carriers O
should O
include O
annual O
mammography O
and O
clinical O
breast O
examination O
every O
6-12 O
months O
, O
starting O
at O
age O
25 O
or O
individualized O
based O
on O
one O
's O
family O
history O
. O

In O
Europe O
, O
ESMO O
also O
recommends O
screening O
with O
annual O
mammography O
and O
MRI O
starting O
at O
age O
25-30 O
. O

Ultrasound O
is O
generally O
not O
recommended O
as O
part O
of O
a O
screening O
algorithm O
but O
is O
utilized O
when O
mammography O
or O
MRI O
reveals O
abnormalities O
. O

The O
addition O
of O
ultrasound O
to O
screening O
mammography O
will O
yield O
an O
additional O
1.1 O
to O
7.2 O
cancers O
per O
1000 O
high-risk O
women B-species
but O
will O
also O
substantially O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
false O
positive O
tests O
. O

Several O
studies O
have O
confirmed O
that O
MRI O
has O
a O
higher O
sensitivity O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
invasive B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
compared O
to O
conventional O
screening O
, O
and O
this O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
most O
applicable O
to O
BRCA1/2-mutation O
carriers O
. O

Rijnsburger O
et O
al O
. O
found O
that O
45.8 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
in O
BRCA-mutation O
carriers O
and O
30.8 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
in O
BRCA2-mutation O
carriers O
were O
detected O
only O
by O
MRI O
. O

However O
, O
MRI O
specificity O
for O
cancer O
detection O
is O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
conventional O
screening O
, O
thereby O
resulting O
in O
more O
unnecessary O
biopsies O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
may O
be O
prudent O
to O
use O
MRI O
in O
conjunction O
with O
conventional O
imaging O
in O
screening O
women B-species
with O
a O
high O
genetic O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
the O
study O
by O
Trecate O
et O
al. O
, O
it O
was O
advised O
to O
consider O
ultrasound O
evaluation O
when O
MRI O
yielded O
the O
only O
positive O
diagnostic O
result O
. O

Lord O
et O
al O
. O
conducted O
a O
systematic O
review O
to O
assess O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
adding O
MRI O
to O
mammography O
with O
or O
without O
ultrasound O
and O
clinical O
examination O
in O
screening O
young O
women B-species
at O
high O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Consistent O
evidence O
in O
a O
number O
of O
studies O
suggests O
that O
adding O
MRI O
provides O
a O
highly O
sensitive O
screening O
strategy O
( O
sensitivity O
range O
: O
93-100 O
% O
) O
compared O
to O
mammography O
alone O
( O
25-59 O
% O
) O
, O
or O
mammography O
and O
ultrasound O
with O
or O
without O
clinical O
examination O
( O
49-67 O
% O
) O
. O

In O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
MRI O
, O
there O
are O
no O
studies O
which O
have O
assessed O
whether O
MRI O
surveillance O
reduces O
the O
rates O
of O
advanced O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
mortality O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
MRI O
on O
improved O
survival O
stems O
from O
the O
assumption O
that O
earlier O
detection O
improves O
survival O

Tamoxifen O
Tamoxifen O
is O
a O

an O
inhibitory O

be O
offered O
tamoxifen O
for O

However O
, O
since O
BRCA1-mutation O

more O
likely O

develop O
ER- O

there O

that O

may O
result O
in O

It O

by O

treated O
with O
tamoxifen O
after O

diagnosis O
of O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
only O
5.5 O
% O
of O
women B-species
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
have O
used O
tamoxifen O
to O
reduce O
their O
breast B-disease

risk O
. O

Approximately O
half O
of O
the O
population O
at O
risk O
relied O
solely O
on O
screening O
for O
the O
early O
detection O
of O
breast B-disease

Patients B-species
should O
be O
counseled O
about O
the O

following O
tamoxifen O
treatment O
( O

compared O
to O
BRCA1/2-mutation O

Hence O
, O
the O
risks O
and O
benefits O
of O
prophylactic O
hysterectomy O
should O
be O
discussed O
with O
those O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
in O

patients B-species

cancer I-disease
, O
subsequent O
treatment O
with O
tamoxifen O
does O
not O
increase O
ovarian B-disease

risk O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
anticipated O
that O
primary O
prophylactic O
tamoxifen O
treatment O
would O
not O
increase O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease

Raloxifene O
The O

Raloxifene O

a O
selective O
estrogen O

, O
which O
is O
used O
primarily O
for O
the O
prevention O

The O
advantages O

raloxifene O
are O
that O
it O

DISCUSSION O
This O

that O
biallelic O

human B-species

The O
only O
other O
known O

had O
a O

. O

Although O
the O
chromosomal O

test O
was O
not O

, O
the O
other O
patient B-species
experienced O
significant O
toxicity O
from O
carboplatin O
, O
suggestive O
of O
hypersensitivity O
to O
interstrand O
crosslink O
reagents O
. O

In O
both O
cases O
, O
the O
patients B-species
had O
either O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
but O
did O
not O
develop O
bone B-disease

which O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
FA-O B-disease

It O
would O
appear O
prudent O
, O
however O
, O
to O
follow O
hematologic O
indices O
in O
patients B-species
with O
biallelic O
BRCA1 B-gene

( O

until O

The O
viability O
of O

also O
has O
important O
implications O
for O
genetic O
counseling O
. O

These O
two O
patients B-species
, O
together O
, O
indicate O
that O
there O
is O
a O
risk O
for O
couples O
in O
which O
each O
partner O
harbors O
a O
pathogenic O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
of O
having O
a O

FA-S B-disease
, O
particularly O
when O
one O
of O
the O

change O
to O
the O
BRCT O

. O

On O
a O
more O
general O
note O
, O
this O
study O
demonstrates O
the O
importance O
of O
looking O
at O
all O
genes O
in O
a O
WES O
study O
, O
and O
highlights O
the O
overlap O
between O
incidental O
and O
diagnostic O
findings O
. O

Biallelic O
BRCA2 B-gene

PALB2 B-gene
mutations O
cause O
a O
severe O

and O
a O
distinct O

, O
which O
predominate O
when O
mutations O
occur O
in O
the O
heterozygous O
state O
. O

Although O
only O
two O
patients B-species
with O
biallelic O
mutations O
in O

have O
been O

it O

We O
posit O
that O

addition O
, O
the O

important O

We O
also O
acknowledge O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
mutations O
outside O
of O
the O

could O
support O

lead O
to O
a O

Nonetheless O
, O
the O

Introduction O
Germline O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
) O
mutations O
are O
present O
in O
approximately O
15 O
% O
of O
unselected O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

Women B-species
with O
deleterious O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
have O
a O
20-50 O
% O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
developing O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
which O
are O
generally O
high O
grade O
, O
high O
stage O
, O
and O
of O
serous O
histology O
. O

The O
median O
age O
of O
onset O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
( O
48-53 O
years O
) O
is O
approximately O
10 O
years O
earlier O
than O
non-hereditary O
cases O
. O

However O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
a O
similar O
age O
of O
onset O
as O
women B-species
without O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Identification O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
offers O
several O
advantages O
. O

Unaffected O
family O
members O
can O
be O
offered O
testing O
to O
clarify O
risk O
and O
tailor O
preventative O
measures O
for O
those O
with O
elevated O
cancer O
risk O
. O

For O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
risk-reducing O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
effectively O
prevents O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
reduces O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
and O
significantly O
improves O
all O
cause O
mortality O
. O

Secondly O
, O
identification O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
may O
augment O
therapeutic O
options O
. O

Inhibitors O
of O
poly-ADP O
ribose O
polymerase O
( O
PARPi O
) O
, O
are O
synthetically O
lethal O
to O
cells O
deficient O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
and O
the O
potential O
to O
use O
PARPi O
's O
therapeutically O
has O
provided O
additional O
incentive O
to O
identify O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Many O
studies O
have O
reported O
improved O
survival O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
likely O
secondary O
to O
improved O
sensitivity O
to O
platinum O
chemotherapy O
. O

However O
, O
these O
studies O
are O
often O
impacted O
by O
selection O
bias O
. O

Even O
prospective O
population O
series O
attempting O
to O
test O
all O
patients B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
have O
suffered O
from O
incomplete O
enrollment O
, O
with O
nearly O
40 O
% O
of O
eligible O
women B-species
not O
enrolled O
. O

The O
most O
common O
reasons O
for O
non-enrollment O
in O
these O
studies O
were O
death O
or O
feeling O
too O
sick O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
avoid O
`` O
survivor O
'' O
bias O
, O
as O
patients B-species
who O
live O
longer O
and O
feel O
better O
may O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
pursue O
genetic O
testing O
, O
potentially O
inflating O
the O
survival O
benefit O
of O
having O
a O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

The O
BROCA O
test O
employs O
targeted O
gene O
capture O
followed O
by O
massively O
parallel O
sequencing O
to O
assess O
for O
mutations O
in O
multiple O
cancer O
susceptibility O
genes O
. O

BROCA O
accurately O
detects O
all O
classes O
of O
mutations O
, O
including O
single O
base-pair O
substitutions O
, O
small O
insertions O
and O
deletions O
, O
and O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
. O

We O
recently O
published O
the O
results O
of O
BROCA O
testing O
in O
a O
prospective O
series O
of O
360 O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
patients B-species
enrolled O
at O
the O
time O
of O
surgery O
and O
not O
selected O
by O
family O
history O
or O
age O
. O

We O
identified O
17.5 O
% O
of O
subjects O
to O
have O
deleterious O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
an O
additional O
6 O
% O
to O
have O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
other O
genes O
. O

Approximately O
two-thirds O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
this O
study O
had O
been O
previously O
identified O
through O
routine O
clinical O
care O
and O
commercial O
testing O
. O

Despite O
the O
routine O
recommendation O
in O
our O
practice O
for O
referral O
of O
all O
women B-species
with O
invasive B-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
to O
genetic O
counseling O
, O
one-third O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
had O
not O
been O
previously O
identified O
. O

We O
wondered O
if O
these O
women B-species
differed O
clinically O
from O
those O
with O
clinically O
identified O
mutations O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
compare O
clinical O
characteristics O
of O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
whose O
mutations O
were O
identified O
through O

to O
those O
who O

. O

Patients B-species
within O
this O

Criteria O
for O

include O
having O
a O

ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
understanding O
the O

. O

Post-operatively O

enrolled O
in O
the O
cancer O

. O

Approximately O
95 O
% O
of O

patients B-species
enroll O
in O
our O
genetics O
studies O
. O

Patients B-species
were O
selected O
for O
analysis O
if O
they O
had O
ovarian B-disease
, I-disease

( O

) O
, O
and O
had O
undergone O
either O
clinical O
or O
research O
testing O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Clinical O
genetic O
testing O
results O
were O
obtained O
from O
the O
medical O
record O

Some O
patients B-species
receive O
their O
surgery O
at O
our O
institution O
but O
follow O
up O
closer O
to O
home O
for O
chemotherapy O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
women B-species
were O
tested O
locally O
with O
our O
without O
referral O
to O
a O
genetic O
counselor O
. O

In O
either O
case O
, O
our O
practice O
was O
to O
recommend O
referral O
to O
a O
genetic O
counselor O
for O
all O
women B-species
with O
invasive B-disease
non-mucinous I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
since O
2005 O
. O

We O
recommend O
referral O
regardless O
of O
participation O
in O
genetics O
studies O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
disruption O
in O

However O
, O
even O
currently O
and O
despite O
multiple O
attempts O

alter O
the O

system O
, O
we O
find O
that O
only O
the O
minority O
of O

meet O
these O
criteria O
do O
get O

Multivariate O

that O
the O
most O
significant O
factors O
that O
influenced O
survival O
in O
mutation O

were O
platinum O

and O

. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
older O
age O
and O
lack O
of O
family O
history O
in O
BROCA O
mutation O
carriers O
does O
not O
explain O
their O
worse O
survival O
compared O
to O
women B-species

. O

The O
increase O
in O
stage O
IV O
disease O
in O
the O
BROCA O
mutation O
carriers O
and O
its O
associated O
impact O
on O
survival O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
poor O
outcomes O
from O
stage O

may O
have O
been O
a O
barrier O
to O
clinical O

Multiple O
population O

studies O
aimed O
at O
determining O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
have O
reported O
that O
the O
primary O
reason O
patients B-species
were O
not O
enrolled O
was O
death O
or O
severe O
illness O
. O

Similarly O
, O
sick O
patients B-species
may O
be O
less O
likely O
to O
participate O
in O
clinical O
genetic O
testing O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
doctors O
may O
be O
less O
inclined O
to O
recommend O
or O
pursue O
genetic O
testing O
for O
very O
sick O
patients B-species
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
the O
clinical O
information O
to O
define O
why O
some O
mutation O
carriers O
had O
not O
received O
clinical O
genetic O
testing O
. O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
known O
mutation O
carriers O
were O
somehow O
given O
different O
treatment O
that O
resulted O
in O
improved O
survival O
, O
although O
this O
explanation O
seems O
less O
likely O
. O

Estimates O
of O
how O
often O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
obtain O
genetic O
testing O
are O
likely O
to O
vary O
by O
country O
and O
by O
center O
. O

Two O
population-based O
assessments O
, O
from O
Australia O
and O
Canada O
( O
where O
testing O
is O
freely O
available O
to O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
patients B-species
) O
have O
shown O
that O
7 O
- O
19 O
% O
of O
patients B-species
obtain O
genetic O
testing O
, O
and O
patients B-species
with O
a O
family O
history O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
obtain O
testing O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
the O
two O
factors O
that O
were O
independent O
predictors O
of O
having O
a O
mutation O
detected O
through O
standard O
clinical O
testing O
were O
younger O
age O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
strong O
family O
history O
. O

Previous O
studies O
have O
found O
that O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
no O
known O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
20 O
- O
44 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
. O

Therefore O
, O
referral O
for O
genetic O
testing O
based O
on O
family O
history O
alone O
will O
miss O
a O
substantial O
number O
of O
cases O
. O

The O
National O
Comprehensive O
Cancer O
Network O
currently O
lists O
a O
personal O
history O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
as O
an O
indication O
for O
genetic O
testing O
, O
with O
no O
other O
requirement O
for O
any O
particular O
family O
history O
. O

The O
increased O
uptake O
of O
genetic O
testing O
amongst O
women B-species
with O
strong O
family O
histories O
likely O
results O
from O
both O
patient B-species
and O
provider O
biases O
. O

We O
found O
that O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
had O
superior O
overall O
survival O
when O
compared O
with O
wildtype O
patients B-species
. O

This O
finding O
has O
already O
been O
well O
established O
in O
multiple O
previous O
publications O
. O

What O
is O
interesting O
is O
that O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
clinically O
undetected O
mutations O
( O
BROCA O
) O
had O
a O
survival O
curve O
similar O
to O
the O
wildtype O
patients B-species
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
clinically O
identified O
mutation O
carriers O
are O
those O
with O
the O
improved O
survival O
. O

Therefore O
, O
including O
only O
routinely O
identified O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
will O
introduce O
significant O
survival O
bias O
into O
analyses O
of O
outcomes O
amongst O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
associated O

Consistent O
with O

we O

, O
and O
a O
higher O
percentage O
of O
high-grade O
serous O

in O

than O

. O

We O
do O
not O

criteria O
for O

as O
all O

Additionally O
, O

There O
are O
many O

that O
prevent O

This O

However O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O

. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
missing O
a O
substantial O
number O

, O

Choosing O
candidate O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
modifier O
genes O
from O
a O
novel O
combinatorial O
approach O
, O
we O
show O
that O
four O
SNPs O
tagged O
to O
three O
of O
the O
14 O
candidate O
genes O
show O
an O
association O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

We O
initiated O
the O
present O
study O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
expectation O
that O
SNPs O
in O
eight O
of O
the O
14 O
genes O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
altered O
expression O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
and O
10 O
of O
the O
14 O
genes O
with O
altered O
expression O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

We O
can O
thus O
argue O
that O
three O
out O
of O
18 O
( O
17 O
% O
) O
valid O
comparisons O
showed O
an O
association O
with O
risk O
. O

For O
either O
interpretation O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
observed O
association O
is O
greater O
than O
the O
one O
in O
20 O
( O
5 O
% O
) O
expected O
by O
chance O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
post O
hoc O
mining O
of O
the O
expression O
dataset O
showed O
that O
another O
SNP O
( O
rs10242920 B-mutation
- O
ELMO1 B-gene
) O
association O
that O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
effect O
reported O
in O
the O
CGEMS O
dataset O
was O
also O
actually O
associated O
with O
altered O
expression O
in O
carriers O
, O
albeit O
with O
less O
significance O
( O
P O
= O
0.005 O
) O
than O
originally O
used O
for O
gene O
and O
SNP O
selection O
. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
combinatorial O
approach O
may O
be O
a O
useful O
method O
to O
prioritise O
candidate O
modifier O
genes O
for O
polymorphism O
association O
studies O
. O

It O
is O
notable O
that O
CIMBA O
GWA O
studies O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
are O
currently O
underway O
. O

One O
might O
therefore O
anticipate O
that O
the O
combinatorial O
approach O
would O
provide O
even O
greater O
enrichment O
for O
prioritising O
SNPs O
from O
GWA O
studies O
that O
directly O
relate O
to O
the O
disease O
state O
under O
study O
. O

Further O
studies O
with O
larger O
cohort O
size O
are O
therefore O
warranted O
to O
assess O
the O
benefit O
of O
carrying O
out O
such O
an O
approach O
. O

Conclusions O
We O
have O
explored O
the O
value O
of O
using O
biological O
information O
embedded O
in O
gene O
expression O
data O
to O
prioritise O
candidate O
modifier O
genes O
for O
SNP O
association O
studies O
. O

Using O
this O
combinatorial O
approach O
we O
were O
able O
to O
demonstrate O
a O
threefold O
enrichment O
of O
genes O
that O
contain O
SNPs O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Most O
notable O
was O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
SMAD3 B-gene
gene O
, O
which O
encodes O
a O
key O
regulatory O
protein O
in O
the O
transforming O
growth O
factor O
beta O
signalling O
pathway O
, O
may O
contribute O
to O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
combinatorial O
approach O
may O
be O
a O
useful O
method O
to O
prioritise O
candidate O
modifier O

to O
the O
Han O

in O
the O
northwest O
of O
China O
, O

. O

It O
is O

Uyghur O
, O
Kazakh O

, O
only O
a O
few O
studies O
have O
been O
reported O
on O
BRCA-associated O
breast B-disease

in O
China O
; O
they O

These O
studies O
revealed O
some O
characteristics O
of O
BRCA-related O
cancer O
in O
Chinese B-species
: O
the O
prevalence O

Introduction O
Epidemiology O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
malignancy O
affecting O
women B-species
worldwide O
. O

According O
to O
GLOBOCAN O
there O
were O
1.38 O
million O
new O
cases O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
world O
in O
2008 O
, O
with O
a O
corresponding O
mortality O
of O
458,000 O
. O

In O
Africa O
, O
over O
the O
same O
time O
period O
, O
there O
were O
68,000 O
new O
cases O
with O
37,000 O
deaths O
documented O
, O
although O
this O
probably O
represents O
a O
gross O
underestimation O
due O
to O
incomplete O
case O
ascertainment O
and O
reporting O
Adesunkanmi O
et O
al O
.. O
In O
2010 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
( O
WHO O
) O
estimated O
that O
there O
would O
be O
97,743 O
new O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
in O
Africa O
, O
with O
an O
estimated O
mortality O
of O
52,855 O
IARC O
. O

The O
reportedly O
lower O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
Africa O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
lower O
life O
expectancy O
, O
incomplete O
record O
keeping O
and O
paucity O
of O
epidemiological O
studies O
and O
incomplete O
case O
ascertainment O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
peculiarities O
in O
the O
presentation O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
Africa O
may O
limit O
detection O
Adesunkanmi O
et O
al O
.. O
These O
include O
an O
apparently O
younger O
age O
and O
later O
stage O
at O
presentation O
with O
more O
aggressive O
tumour O
characteristics O
Adesunkanmi O
et O
al O
.. O
The O
late O
presentation O
which O
may O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
poor O
health O
seeking O
behaviour O
is O
also O
compounded O
by O
the O
more O
aggressive O
nature O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
Africa O
. O

The O
cause O
( O
s O
) O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
remain O
largely O
unknown O
, O
though O
several O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
characterised O
. O

The O
most O
important O
factors O
are O
the O
age O
of O
the O
patient B-species
and O
the O
effect O
of O
female O
sex O
hormones O
. O

Thus O
early O
menarche O
, O
late O
menopause O
and O
nulliparity O
all O
confer O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Breast O
feeding O
is O
noted O
to O
be O
protective O
while O
ingestion O
of O
exogenous O
female O
sex O
hormones O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

A O
positive O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
known O
to O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
only O
in O
1990 O
, O
based O
on O
the O
results O
of O

performed O
by O

for O
the O
existence O
of O
at O

one O

In O

there O
has O
been O
a O
paucity O

This O

Introduction O
Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
malignancy O
in O
females O
and O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
causes O
of O
death O
from O
cancer O
in O
women B-species
worldwide O
. O

It O
accounts O
for O
23 O
% O
of O
all O
cancers O
among O
women B-species
and O
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
cancer O
overall O
when O
both O
sexes O
are O
considered O
. O

Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
showed O
the O
biggest O
proportional O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
new O
cases O
in O
women B-species
from O
2006-2011 O
and O
remains O
the O
leading O
form O
of O
cancer O
in O
women B-species
in O
Kazakhstan O
. O

Germline O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene

account O
for O
genetic O

Two O
major O

are O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
MIM O

) O
, O
located O
on O
the O
long O
arms O
of O
chromosomes O
17 O
and O
13 O
, O
respectively O
, O
and O
both O
apparently O
function O
as O
tumor O
suppressor O
genes O
. O

BRCA1 O
is O
a O
large O
protein O
of O
1863 O
amino O
acids O
and O
BRCA2 O
, O
with O
3418 O
amino O
acids O
, O
is O
even O
larger O
. O

Both O
proteins O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
control O
of O
homologous O
recombination O
( O
HR O
) O
and O
double-strand O
break O

in O

to O
DNA O

. O

BRCA1/2 B-gene
have O
been O
shown O
to O
serve O
as O
important O
central O
components O
in O
multiple O
biological O
pathways O
that O
regulate O
cell-cycle O
progression O
, O
centrosome O

, O

and O

Evidence O

or O
low O
expression O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
in O
a O
large O
proportion O

cases O
supports O
the O
role O

provided O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
location O

as O
having O

mutation O
; O
it O
was O
found O
that O
the O
most O
commonly O
encountered O
sporadic O
forms O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
vary O
among O
different O
populations O
. O

This O
contributory O
variation O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
their O
different O
gene O
pool O
make O
and O
also O
due O
to O
low O
penetrance O
gene O
involvement O
. O

However O
, O
some O
studies O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
germline O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
contribute O
little O
to O
the O
induction O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
some O
countries O
. O

Mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
were O
first O
reported O
in O
conjunction O
with O
their O
identification O
in O
1994 O
and O
1995 O
. O

During O
last O
decade O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
been O
extensively O
screened O
for O
mutations O
; O
numerous O
mutations O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
clearly O
associated O
with O
cancer O
susceptibility O
and O
have O
been O
registered O
in O
the O
Breast O
Cancer O
Information O
Core O
Database O
( O
BIC O
) O
. O

Most O
of O
these O
are O
frameshift O
or O
nonsense O
mutations O
leading O
to O
truncated O
and O
therefore O
, O
inactive O
BRCA1/2 O
proteins O
. O

These O
mutations O
have O
a O
pathogenetic O
role O
and O
are O
characterized O
by O
a O
high O
penetrance O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they O
are O
thought O
to O
increase O
the O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
50 O
% O
by O
age O
50 O
and O
85 O
% O
by O
age O
70 O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
alterations O
have O
been O
reported O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
genes O
, O
but O
not O
all O
are O
able O
to O
confer O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
with O
age O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
pathogenetic O
effect O
of O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
single O
amino O
acid O
changes O
is O
still O
unknown O
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
true O
for O
polymorphisms O
, O
naturally O
occurring O
gene O
sequence O
variations O
, O
often O
affecting O
only O
a O
single O
nucleotide O
, O
that O
have O
recently O
been O
associated O
with O
altered O
cancer O
risk O
. O

There O
are O
also O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
single O
amino O
acid O
changes O
that O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
classified O
as O
non-characterized O
variants O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
whether O
these O
variants O
may O
affect O
BRCA1 B-gene
function O
and O
thus O
bring O
about O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Disease-associated O
mutations O
are O
distributed O
over O
the O
entire O
coding O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
, O
and O
these O
demonstrate O
considerable O

in O
our O

In O
the O

the O

Given O
that O
the O

further O

In O

The O

in O
view O
of O
the O
relatively O
high O

frequencies O
( O

of O
these O

. O

Because O
of O
the O
unavailability O
of O
a O
functional O
BRCA O
protein O
assay O
system O
, O
the O
disease O
associations O
of O
other O

remain O
uncertain O
. O

However O
, O
the O
possibility O
can O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
that O
some O
of O
these O
unverified O
variants O
are O
pathogenically O
relevant O
. O

No O
deleterious O
mutations O
were O
detected O
in O
either O
gene O
among O

groups O
. O

The O
lack O
in O
the O
germline O
of O
clearly O
deleterious O
alterations O
might O
be O
unsurprising O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
these O
are O
extremely O
rare O
in O
patients B-species
not O
selected O
due O
to O
a O
family O
history O
and/or O
early O
disease O

. O

However O
, O
the O
true O
contribution O
made O
by O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
to O
sporadic B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
remains O
controversial O
for O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
missense O
mutations O
with O
an O
unknown O
significance O
could O
have O
a O
pathogenic O
effect O
. O

Secondly O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
missense O
mutations O
, O
silent O
polymorphisms O
may O
affect O
the O
splicing O
mechanism O
. O

However O
, O
these O
variants O
can O
not O
be O
classified O
as O
disease O
associated O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
good O
functional O
assay O
system O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

When O
a O
functional O
assay O
becomes O
available O
, O
it O
will O
be O
important O
to O
elucidate O
the O
relevance O
of O
such O

To O
our O

Although O

In O

Armstrong O
( O

observed O
that O

, O
the O

Furthermore O
, O
a O
meta-analysis O
by O

Breast B-disease
Cancer I-disease
in O
which O
BRCA1 B-gene

PMH O
does O
not O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in O
familial O
high-risk O
women B-species
. O

Growing O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
a O
heterogeneous O
disease O
with O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-associated O
tumors O
exhibiting O
a O
distinct O
morphologic O
and O
molecular O
signature O

BRCA2 B-gene

more O
likely O

exhibit O
the O
luminal O

with O
estrogen O

( O

positive O
receptors O
, O
while O
BRCA1 B-gene
tumors O
exhibit O
a O

. O

Paradoxically O
, O
estrogen O
suppression O
by O
oophorectomy O
in O
pre-menopausal O
women B-species
has O
been O
shown O
not O
only O
to O
substantially O
reduce O
risk O
of O
subsequent O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
but O
also O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

The O
use O
of O
tamoxifen O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
risk O
of O
contralateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

Functional O
studies O
show O
that O
BRCA1 O
expression O
is O
responsive O
to O
estrogen O
levels O
and O
represses O
estrogen-dependent O
and O

transactivational O
activity O

Mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
may O
remove O
this O
inhibitory O
effect O
, O
thereby O
increasing O
epithelial O
proliferation O
in O
the O
breast O
. O

Estrogen O
also O
activates O
BRCA2 O
function O
to O
increase O
DNA O
repair O

in O

In O
addition O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene

a O
progesterone O
antagonist O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
prevent O
BRCA1-mediated O
tumorigenesis O
in O

These O
findings O
support O
the O

associated O
with O
estrogen O
exposure O
in O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O

This O
study O
has O
several O
limitations O
. O

We O
did O
not O
screen O
for O
larger O
genomic O
deletions O
or O
duplications O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
that O
may O
occur O
in O
up O
to O
12 O
% O
of O
women B-species
with O
strong O
family O
histories O
and O
who O
test O
negative O
for O
deleterious O

. O

There O
may O
be O
additional O
misclassification O
due O
to O
limited O
information O
on O
function O
of O
variants O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
not O

Lastly O
, O
we O
are O
limited O
by O
the O
number O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene

, O
which O
precluded O
us O
from O

This O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O
investigate O
the O
role O
of O
OC O

use O
in O
the O

Additional O
strengths O
of O
this O
study O
include O
: O
systematic O
collection O
of O
data O
, O
careful O
matching O
of O
cases O
to O
controls O
, O
the O
abstraction O
of O

to O

cancer-free O
interval O
for O
controls O
and O
treatment O
history O
for O
both O
cases O
and O
controls O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
by O
limiting O
initial O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnoses O
to O
localized O
and O
regional O
disease O
and O
specifying O
a O
minimum O
interval O
of O
one O

between O
first O

diagnosis O
of O
the O
case O
subjects O
, O
we O
limited O
the O
potential O
for O
misclassification O
of O

. O

This O
study O
has O
avoided O
biases O
associated O
with O
use O
of O
high-risk O
or O
selected O
populations O
by O
ascertaining O
cases O
and O
controls O
via O
multiple O
population-based O
cancer O
registries O
, O
which O
lends O
to O
greater O
generalizability O
of O
the O
findings O
. O

We O
have O
also O
implemented O
strong O
quality O
control O
procedures O
to O
ensure O
accurate O
genotyping O
of O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
observed O
no O
significant O
evidence O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
OC/PMH O
use O
on O
risk O
of O
contralateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
differs O
between O
non-carriers O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
because O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
a O
higher O
baseline O
risk O
of O
second O
breast O
primaries O
compared O
to O
non-carriers O
, O
the O
potential O
increased O
risks O
associated O
with O
OC O
use O
may O
be O
clinically O
relevant O
. O

These O
results O
merit O
further O
confirmation O
in O
larger O

of O

Synthetic O
lethality O
is O
the O
phenomenon O
whereby O
cell O
death O
results O
from O
the O
loss O
of O
function O
of O
two O
different O
gene O
products O
, O
when O
loss O
of O
either O
gene O
product O
in O
isolation O
does O
not O
. O

This O
concept O
has O
led O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
a O
new O
class O
of O
agents O
, O
PARP O
inhibitors O
, O
could O
be O
effective O
at O
treating O
BRCA1/2 O
dysfunctional O
cancers O
. O

PARP-1 O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
regulator O
of O
base O
excision O
repair O
( O
BER O
) O
. O

One O
model O
suggests O
that O
PARP-1 O
inhibition O
traps O
one O
of O
the O
single O
strand O
break O
intermediates O
in O
the O
BER O
process O
and O
prevents O
the O
final O
ligation O
step O
. O

PARP O
also O
plays O
a O
role O
at O
stalled O
replication O
forks O
and O
is O
often O
hyperAactivated O
in O
cells O
defective O
in O
homologous O

such O
as O

or O
defective O
cells O
. O

Inhibition O
of O
PARP O
in O
cells O
with O
dysfunctional O
homologous O
recombination O
repair O
therefore O
results O
in O
the O
inhibition O
of O
two O
major O
DNA O
repair O
pathways O
. O

Studies O
have O
demonstrated O
this O
synthetic O
lethality O
by O
inhibiting O
PARP O
in O
cells O
deficient O
in O
BRCA1/2 O
. O

The O

in O

have O
also O

Recently O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
somatic O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
also O
frequent O
in O
ovarian B-disease

some O

Some O

that O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

a O

The O

of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
deleterious O

in O
1/41 O
cell O

, O
from O
33 O
patients B-species
( O
3.0 O
% O
) O
is O
much O
lower O
than O
the O
population O

. O

The O
reversion O
mutations O
and O
high O
frequency O
of O
heterozygous O
mutations O
( O
14.6 O
% O
) O
suggest O
that O
there O
is O
a O
selective O
pressure O
against O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
during O
adaption O
to O
cell O
culture O
similar O
to O
the O
selective O
pressure O
seen O
in O
the O
clinic O
after O
treatment O
with O

. O

PARP O
inhibitors O
may O
be O
useful O
in O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
deleterious O

or O

but O
further O
studies O
of O
this O
observation O
are O
needed O
. O

Some O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

are O
also O
sensitive O
to O
PARP O
inhibition O
, O
particularly O
those O
derived O
from O

. O

Further O
research O
is O

which O

Introduction O
The O
majority O
of O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
are O
of O
high-grade O
serous O
or O
undifferentiated O
histology O
and O
present O
with O
established O
metastatic O
disease O
. O

Early O
detection O
strategies O
have O
been O
hindered O
by O
an O
inability O
to O
define O
the O
molecular O
progression O
of O
a O
clear O
precursor O
lesion O
. O

Approximately O
10-15 O
% O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
occur O
in O
women B-species
with O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
who O
have O
an O
estimated O
20-50 O
% O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

Multiple O
studies O
have O
examined O
the O
prophylactically O
removed O
ovaries O
of O
these O
women B-species
in O
attempts O
to O
find O
precursor O
lesions O
in O
ovarian O
epithelium O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
recent O
studies O
with O
pathologists O
blinded O
to O
patient B-species
status O
using O
both O
standard O
light O
microscopy O
and O
immunohistochemistry O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
identify O
a O
reproducible O

( O
preneoplastic O
or O
non-invasive O
neoplastic O
) O
lesion O
in O
ovarian O
epithelium O
from O
high-risk O
women B-species
. O

Recently O
, O
a O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
considered O
the O
role O
of O
the O
fallopian O
tube O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
high-grade O
serous B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
of I-disease
the I-disease
ovary I-disease
and I-disease
peritoneum I-disease
. O

Occult B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
identified O
at O
the O
time O
of O
risk-reducing O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
( O
RRSO O
) O
in O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
found O
in O
4.4-38 O
% O
of O
high-risk O
women B-species
undergoing O
RRSO O
, O
with O
57-100 O
% O
of O
lesions O
found O
in O
the O
fallopian O
tube O
. O

These O
findings O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
most O
hereditary B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
of I-disease
the I-disease
ovary I-disease
and I-disease
peritoneum I-disease
are O
seeded O
by O
neoplastic O
cells O
from O
the O
fallopian O
tube O
. O

Carcinomas O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
typically O
lost O
the O
wildtype O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
allele O
. O

Loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
has O
also O
been O
described O
in O
high-grade O
intraepithelial B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
in O
the O
fallopian O
tubes O
of O
mutation O
carriers O
, O
indicating O
that O
loss O
of O
the O
wildtype O
allele O
is O
an O
early O
step O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
related O
carcinogenesis O
. O

High-grade O
serous B-disease
pelvic I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
have O
a O
high O
rate O
of O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
( O
50-80 O
% O
) O
. O

Fallopian O
tubes O
from O
women B-species
with O
and O
without O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
have O
recently O
been O
found O
to O
contain O
clusters O
of O
epithelial O
cells O
with O
immunostaining O
for O
p53 O
, O
called O
`` O
p53 O
signatures O
'' O
. O

These O
foci O
of O
p53 O
positive O
cells O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
contain O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
and O
have O
been O
hypothesized O
to O
represent O
precursor O
lesions O
to O
high-grade O
serous B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
. O

Interestingly O
, O
fallopian O
tubes O
from O
control O
women B-species
have O
been O
found O
to O
have O
a O
similar O
rate O
of O
p53 O
foci O
as O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
despite O
their O
much O
lower O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

If O
p53 O
foci O
are O
the O
site O
of O
later O
neoplastic O
proliferation O
, O
there O
should O
be O
other O
molecular O
alterations O
that O
distinguish O
these O
foci O
in O
normal O
and O
high O
risk O
women B-species
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
molecular O
events O
that O
differentiate O
fallopian O
tube O
epithelium O
in O
women B-species
with O
and O
without O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

We O
examined O
expression O
of O
p53 O
and O
Ki-67 O
( O
a O
protein O
used O
as O
a O
marker O
for O
cellular O
proliferation O
) O
in O
histologically O
normal O
fallopian O
tube O
epithelium O
from O
normal-risk O
controls O
, O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
who O
have O
undergone O
risk-reducing O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
( O
RRSO O
) O
, O
and O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
who O
have O
developed O
overt O
gynecologic O
carcinomas O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
characterized O
proliferation O
and O
expression O
of O
regulators O
of O
the O
cell O
cycle O
( O
Ki-67 O
, O
p27 O
, O
and O
p21 O
) O
within O
p53 O
foci O
in O
tubal O
epithelium O
to O
define O
molecular O
alterations O
that O
could O
impact O
neoplastic O
potential O
in O
the O
p53 O
foci O
of O
high-risk O
women B-species
. O

We O
examined O
cases O
of O
tubal B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
and O
non-neoplastic O
p53 O
foci O
for O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
at O
the O
known O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
to O
define O
the O
molecular O
progression O
of O
these O
lesions O
. O

From O
these O
data O
we O
are O
able O
to O
add O
significant O
detail O
to O
a O
model O
for O
the O
molecular O

Discussion O
The O
relatively O
high O
rate O
of O
p53 O
foci O
in O
tubal O
epithelium O
of O
normal O
risk O
women B-species
in O
this O
study O
, O
and O
others O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
relative O
infrequency O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in O
these O
women B-species
suggests O
that O
other O
alterations O
are O
necessary O
if O
these O
foci O
serve O
as O
potential O
sites O
of O
malignant O
transformation O
. O

In O
order O
to O
define O
differences O
in O
neoplastic O
potential O
between O
p53 O
foci O
in O
high O
and O
normal O
risk O
women B-species
, O
we O
examined O
protein O
expression O
of O
the O
cell-cycle O
inhibitors O
p27 O
and O
p21 O
, O
and O
the O
proliferation O
marker O
Ki-67 O
within O
p53 O
foci O
. O
p27 O
expression O
was O
frequently O
decreased O
in O
p53 O
foci O
from O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
( O
and O
some O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
) O
, O
but O
was O
never O
decreased O
in O
control O
foci O
( O
p=0.002 O
) O
. O

These O
data O
are O
the O
first O
to O
demonstrate O
a O
difference O
between O
p53 O
foci O
in O
high O
risk O
women B-species
and O
those O
occurring O
in O
women B-species
unlikely O
to O
develop O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

Consequently O
, O
these O
data O
support O
the O
neoplastic O
potential O
of O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
the O
p53 O
foci O
that O
arise O
in O
tubal O
epithelium O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Conversely O
, O
retention O
of O
normal O
cell O
cycle O
checkpoints O
in O
p53 O
foci O
in O
normal O
risk O
women B-species
may O
explain O
the O
rarity O
of O
neoplastic O
progression O
of O
these O
lesions O
in O
women B-species
at O
normal O
risk O
for O
ovarian B-disease
or I-disease
tubal I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

Alterations O
in O
TP53 B-gene
have O
been O
suggested O
to O
be O
a O
prerequisite O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
associated O
carcinogenesis O
. O

TP53 B-gene
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
a O
small O
number O
of O
tested O
p53 O
foci O
( O
from O
women B-species
with O
and O
without O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
) O
, O
and O
in O
one O
case O
the O
identical O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
was O
found O
in O
a O
co-existing O
intraepithelial B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
( O
IEN B-disease
, O
also O
called O
tubal B-disease
intraepithelial I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
) O
. O

Similarly O
, O
Kindelberger O
and O
colleagues O
identified O
the O
same O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
in O
tubal O
IEN B-disease
and O
co-existent O
sporadic O
pelvic O
serous B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
. O

These O
data O
and O
ours O
suggest O
that O
alterations O
of O
TP53 B-gene
are O
not O
only O
important O
for O
neoplastic O
progression O
but O
may O
precede O
a O
histologically O
identifiable O
neoplasm O
in O
at O
risk O
epithelium O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
a O
lower O
percentage O
of O
p53 O
foci O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
loss O
of O
p27 O
compared O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

If O
loss O
of O
p27 O
contributes O
to O
neoplastic O
transformation O
of O
p53 O
foci O
, O
then O
the O
decreased O
rate O
of O
p27 O
loss O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
p53 O
foci O
could O
be O
related O
to O
the O
lower O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in O
women B-species
with O
BRCA2 B-gene
compared O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
the O
lower O
rate O
of O
p27 O
loss O
may O
indicate O
that O
alterations O
in O
CDKN1B B-gene
( O
encoding O
p27 O
) O
plays O
a O
less O
prominent O
role O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
compared O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
tubal B-disease
carcinogenesis I-disease
. O

CDKN1B B-gene
acts O
as O
a O
tumor O
suppressor O
by O
negatively O
regulating O
the O
transition O
from O
G0 O
to O
S O
phase O
via O
inhibition O
of O
cyclin O
E-CDK2 O
. O

Studies O
in O
human B-species
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cell O
lines O
demonstrate O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
is O
a O
transcriptional O
activator O
of O
the O
CDKN1B B-gene
promoter O
. O

Breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
in O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
characteristically O
have O
decreased O
p27 O
expression O
compared O
to O
sporadic O
carcinomas O
and O
normal O
breast O
tissue O
. O

BRCA1/2 B-gene
carcinomas O
typically O
have O
lost O
the O
wildtype O
allele O
. O

Similarly O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
loss O
of O
the O
wildtype O
allele O
in O
all O
six O
early O
tubal B-disease
neoplasms I-disease
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

However O
, O
in O
five O
non-neoplastic O
p53 O
foci O
we O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
for O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
. O

Thus O
, O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
and O
decreased O
p27 O
expression O
appear O
to O
occur O
before O
loss O
of O
the O
wildtype O
allele O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
tubal B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
. O

Haploinsufficiency O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
in O
combination O
with O
a O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
p27 O
in O
p53 O
foci O
of O
non-neoplastic O
tubal O
epithelium O
. O

The O
decrease O
in O
p27 O
expression O
and O
resultant O
loss O
of O
cell O
cycle O
inhibition O
could O
then O
result O
in O
increased O
cell O
proliferation O
and O
neoplastic O
potential O
. O

The O
six O
cases O
with O
early O
tubal B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
all O
had O
loss O
of O
the O
wildtype O
allele O
. O

Therefore O
, O
both O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
and O
p27 O
loss O
precede O
loss O
of O
the O
wildtype O
allele O
, O
which O
is O
probably O
the O
rate O
limiting O
step O
for O
neoplastic O
transformation O
. O

By O
the O
time O
loss O
of O
the O
wildtype O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
allele O
occurs O
, O
neoplastic O
proliferation O
is O
histologically O
evident O
. O

Ki-67 O
was O
elevated O
in O
a O
minority O
of O
p53 O
foci O
from O
both O
normal O
risk O
women B-species
and O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

These O
data O
are O
similar O
to O
findings O
recently O
reported O
by O
Shaw O
and O
colleagues O
. O

Most O
pathologically O
recognized O
intraepithelial B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
( O
in B-disease
situ I-disease
or I-disease
early I-disease
invasive I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
) O
has O
both O
increased O
Ki-67 O
and O
p53 O
. O

However O
, O
co-expression O
of O
Ki-67 O
and O
p53 O
does O
not O
define O
IEN B-disease
in O
the O
absence O
of O
severe O
cytological O
or O
architectural O
atypia O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Shaw O
and O
colleagues O
demonstrated O
that O
21 O
% O
of O
high O
grade O
IEN B-disease
will O
not O
over-express O
p53 O
and O
one O
of O
the O
tubal B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
also O
lacked O
p53 O
expression O
. O

Therefore O
it O
is O
important O
to O
define O
clear O
histopathological O
criteria O
for O
diagnosing O
tubal B-disease
neoplasms I-disease
that O
does O
not O
rely O
on O
the O
p53 O
and O
Ki-67 O
expression O
pattern O
. O

It O
is O
critical O
to O
avoid O
both O
under O
and O
over-diagnosing O
tubal O
IEN B-disease
as O
some O
patients B-species
receive O
chemotherapy O
for O
these O
lesions O
. O

Ki-67 O
expression O
was O
globally O
increased O
in O
tubal O
epithelium O
from O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
undergoing O
RRSO O
compared O
to O
normal O
risk O
women B-species
. O

Similarly O
, O
Piek O
and O
colleagues O
found O
a O
higher O
proportion O
of O
Ki-67 O
expressing O
tubal O
epithelial O
cells O
in O
morphologically O
normal O
tissue O
removed O
for O
risk-reduction O
when O
compared O
with O
controls O
in O
a O
small O
series O
of O
12 O
high-risk O
women B-species
that O
included O
7 O
with O
confirmed O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Burga O
and O
colleagues O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
human B-species
mammary O
epithelial O
cells O
heterozygous O
for O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
have O
a O
higher O
proliferative O
rate O
in O
cell O
culture O
compared O
to O
wildtype O
mammary O
cells O
. O

Together O
, O
these O
data O
suggest O
that O
haploinsufficiency O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
influences O
proliferation O
in O
breast O
and O
tubal O
epithelium O
, O
those O
tissues O
most O
at O
risk O
for O
malignant O
transformation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

In O
our O
series O
, O
those O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
undergoing O
RRSO O
who O
had O
p53 O
foci O
had O
more O
tubal O
epithelial O
proliferation O
compared O
to O
those O
without O
foci O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
conditions O
of O
increased O
proliferation O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
p53 O
foci O
. O

In O
normal O
risk O
women B-species
, O
we O
identified O
a O
highly O
significant O
inverse O
correlation O
of O
tubal O
epithelial O
proliferation O
and O
age O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
relationship O
of O
decreasing O
proliferation O
with O
advancing O
age O
was O
less O
prominent O
in O
the O
tubal O
epithelium O
of O
high-risk O
women B-species
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
the O
increased O
proliferation O
in O
tubal O
epithelium O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
particularly O
as O
they O
age O
, O
sets O
the O
stage O
for O
neoplastic O
transformation O
. O

We O
observed O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
frequency O
of O
p53 O
foci O
in O
those O
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
compared O
to O
controls O
, O
particularly O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
overt B-disease
or I-disease
occult I-disease
gynecologic I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
. O

The O
percentage O
of O
women B-species
with O
any O
p53 O
foci O
is O
consistent O
with O
data O
from O
Christopher O
Crum O
's O
group O
at O
Brigham O
and O
Women O
's O
Hospital O
that O
first O
described O
the O
existence O
of O
p53 O
foci O
in O
tubal O
epithelium O
, O
and O
higher O
than O
the O
rate O
found O
by O
Shaw O
et O
al O
. O

However O
, O
neither O
Shaw O
and O
colleagues O
nor O
Crum O
and O
colleagues O
found O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
number O
of O
p53 O
foci O
between O
cases O
and O
controls O
, O
and O
neither O
evaluated O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
with O
overt O
carcinomas O
. O

Because O
p53 O
foci O
are O
a O
relatively O
rare O
event O
, O
the O
identification O
of O
p53 O
foci O
is O
likely O
to O
depend O
on O
the O
volume O
of O
tubal O
epithelium O
evaluated O
. O

In O
order O
to O
account O
for O
variable O
tubal O
epithelial O
volumes O
between O
cases O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
number O
of O
p53 O
foci O
per O
number O
of O
tubal O
sections O
evaluated O
. O

Fewer O
tubal O
sections O
were O
available O
in O
our O
cases O
from O
women B-species
with O
overt O
carcinoma O
, O
but O
the O
number O
of O
p53 O
foci/tubal O
section O
was O
highest O
in O
these O
cases O
( O
Tables O
1 O
and O
2 O
) O
. O

We O
had O
a O
sufficient O
number O
of O
women B-species
undergoing O
RRSO O
to O
analyze O
the O
data O
separately O
for O
women B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
and O
the O
rate O
of O
p53 O
foci O
was O
similar O
for O
tubal O
epithelium O
with O
mutations O
in O
either O
gene O
( O
Table O

) O
. O

While O
the O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
related O
carcinomas O
tended O
to O
be O
older O
, O
there O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
in O
age O
between O
those O
with O
and O
without O
p53 O
foci O
, O
a O
finding O
which O
has O
been O
confirmed O
by O
Saleemudin O
et O
al O
. O

Previous O
authors O
have O
suggested O
a O
model O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
tubal B-disease
carcinogenesis I-disease
based O
on O
the O
progression O
of O
p53 O
foci O
to O
overt O
neoplasia O
. O

Our O
data O
allows O
us O
to O
expand O
this O
model O
and O
add O
potential O
molecular O
details O
( O
Figure O
4 O
) O
. O

We O
propose O
that O
haploinsufficiency O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
leads O
to O
increased O
tubal O
epithelial O
proliferation O
( O
as O
evidenced O
by O
increased O
Ki-67 O
expression O
) O
. O

This O
tubal O
proliferation O
does O
not O
decrease O
appropriately O
with O
advancing O
age O
( O
as O
is O
the O
case O
with O
normal-risk O
women B-species
) O
. O

These O
conditions O
support O
the O
clonal O
expansion O
of O
tubal O
cells O
with O
random O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
leading O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
p53 O
foci O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
haploinsufficient O
epithelium O
. O

Decrease O
of O
p27 O

occurs O
in O
cells O
that O
are O
TP53 B-gene

and O
BRCA1 B-gene
haploinsufficient O
leading O
to O
loss O
of O

and O
increased O
neoplastic O
potential O
. O

Finally O
, O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
occurs O
at O
the O

Introduction O
The O
two O
major O
susceptibility O
genes O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
BC B-disease
) O
and O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
OC B-disease
) O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
MIM O
: O
113705 O
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
MIM O
: O
600185 O
) O
were O
discovered O
in O
1994 O
and O
1995 O
, O
respectively O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
Protein O
Truncation O
Test O
( O
PTT O
) O
was O
the O
screening O
method O
widely O
used O
as O
a O
quick O
and O
inexpensive O
test O
to O
detect O
pathogenic O
truncating O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
. O

At O
a O
later O
stage O
, O
the O
screening O
was O
optimised O
using O
denaturing O
high O
performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
( O
DHPLC O
) O
, O
direct O
sequencing O
and O
Multiplex O
Ligation-dependent O
Probe O
Amplification O
( O
MLPA O
) O
, O
in O
which O
all O
types O
of O
mutations O
or O
deletions O
could O
be O
detected O
. O

A O
drawback O
of O
this O
optimised O
screening O
methodology O
is O
that O
, O
as O
compared O
to O
PTT O
, O
it O
is O
laborious O
and O
more O
expensive O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
these O
two O
genes O
only O
account O
for O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
the O
familial O
clustering O
of O
BC B-disease
and O
OC B-disease
in O
the O
total O
group O
of O
index O
patients B-species
. O

Therefore O
, O
accurate O
selection O
criteria O
for O
patients B-species
eligible O
for O
DNA-analysis O
are O
mandatory O
. O

Various O
risk O
prediction O
algorithms O
and O
models O
have O
been O
developed O
to O
identify O
putative O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

The O
first O
published O
model O
was O
that O
of O
the O
University O
of O
Pennsylvania O
( O
U-Penn O
) O
, O
also O
called O
the O
Couch O
model O
; O
followed O
by O
Shattuck-Eidens O
model O
or O
Myriad O
I O
; O
Myriad O
II O
, O
an O
extension O
of O
the O
previous O
model O
; O
the O
Myriad O
tables O
by O
Frank O
et O

. O
; O
the O
BRCAPRO O
model O
; O
the O
Manchester O

of O
Evans O
et O
al O
. O
and O
the O
recent O
BOADICEA O
model O
of O
Antoniou O
et O
al O
.. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
different O
types O
of O
models O
, O
also O
the O
thresholds O
used O
in O
these O
models O
to O
establish O
the O
indication O
to O
perform O
DNA-analysis O
, O
vary O
substantially O
among O
countries O
. O

In O
1996 O
, O
the O
American O
Society O
of O
Clinical O
Oncology O
recommended O
that O
consideration O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
testing O
should O
be O
offered O
to O
patients B-species
with O
strong O
familial O
features O
, O
such O
as O
BC B-disease
in O
the O
family O
or O
very O
early O
age O
at O
onset O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
c.q O
. O
corresponding O
to O
those O
patients B-species
whose O
prior O
probability O
of O
carrying O
a O
mutation O
exceeds O
10 O
% O
. O

However O
, O
the O
updated O
American O
guidelines O
in O
2003 O
did O
not O
recommend O
a O
numerical O
threshold O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
Dutch O
Cancer O
Genetics O
Services O
apply O
a O
10 O
% O
pre-test O
probability O
as O
threshold O
to O
perform O
DNA O
analysis O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O
UK O
most O
centres O
offer O
mutation O
analysis O
to O
families O
with O
a O
20 O
% O
or O
greater O
pre-test O
probability O
of O
carrying O
a O
mutation O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
our O

was O
to O

From O
1995 O

2000 O
, O
the O
PTT O
was O
the O
widely O

technique O
, O
which O
at O
that O
time O
resulted O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
a O

in O
20 O
unrelated O
patients B-species
. O

At O
a O
later O
stage O
, O
complete O
sequencing O
analysis O
of O
the O
coding O
regions O
including O
intron-exon O
boundaries O
was O
performed O
, O
which O
resulted O
in O
the O
identification O
of O
an O
additional O
43 O
genetic O
variations O
in O
individual O
probands B-species
of O
which O
32 O
were O
pathogenic O
and O
11 O
unclassified O
( O
UV O
) O
. O

We O
then O
performed O
a O
retrospective O
study O
to O
estimate O
the O
mutation O
probabilities O
using O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
in O
all O
cases O
. O

Concerning O
mutation O
detection O
rate O
, O
our O
results O
are O
in O
line O
with O
previous O
reports O
( O
which O
show O
that O
complete O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

substantially O
increases O
the O

However O
, O
it O
is O

which O
methods O

use O

the O

In O
this O

, O
the O
right O

determined O
: O
obviously O
, O
the O
ideal O
method O
has O
a O
high O
sensitivity O
, O
a O
high O
specificity O
and O
a O
high O
negative O
predictive O
value O
. O

We O
found O
in O
our O
population O
study O
that O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
are O
more O
specific O
than O
cancer O

since O
they O
both O
excluded O

did O
not O

Noteworthy O
is O
that O
the O
four O
pathogenic O

that O

were O

that O
all O

This O
suggests O
that O
for O
detection O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
, O
BRCAPRO O
at O
a O
threshold O
of O
10 O
% O
is O
the O

i.e. O
, O
it O
has O
the O

reduces O

The O
fact O
that O
these O
probability O

have O
a O
better O
performance O
for O

has O
been O
reported O
previously O
by O
James O

Bodmer O

, O
and O
is O
related O
to O
the O
lower O
penetrance O
of O

in O

Indeed O
, O
as O
explained O
in O
the O

section O
, O
none O
of O

such O
as O

. O

An O
additional O
advantage O
of O
the O
use O
of O
models O
with O
thresholds O
is O
the O
exclusion O
of O
many O
patients B-species

an O

Indeed O
, O
since O
the O
majority O
of O
the O

that O
have O
been O
detected O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
literature O
are O
later O
reclassified O
as O
neutral O

, O
a O
specific O
method O
is O
also O
desirable O
which O
can O
selectively O
exclude O
those O
UVs O
which O
are O
not O
clinically O
relevant O
. O

We O
have O
previously O
reported O
that O
patients B-species
with O
a O
pathogenic O
mutation O
have O
significantly O
higher O
a O

probabilities O
with O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
than O
those O
with O
a O
UV O
, O
which O
also O
suggests O
that O
most O
of O
the O
UVs O
are O
neutral O
variants O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
useful O
parameters O
also O
to O
predict O
whether O
a O
UV O

when O
used O
in O

Interestingly O
, O
from O
the O
two O
UVs O
with O

with O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
, O
the O

Conversely O
, O

, O
evidence O

This O

the O
case O

In O
conclusion O
, O
BRCAPRO O

When O

, O
BRCAPRO O

more O
sensitive O
in O

Myriad O

Myriad O

BRCAPRO O
performs O

These O

Mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
found O
in O
a O
proportion O
of O
multiple O
case O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
. O

The O
particular O
mutations O
that O
are O
present O
differ O
from O
family O
to O
family O
indicating O
the O
marked O
allelic O
heterogeneity O
of O
these O
genes O
. O

The O
only O
viable O
methods O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
mutations O
in O
genes O
prone O
to O
such O
variation O
are O
sequencing O
or O
extensive O
DNA O
screening O
techniques O
. O

Mutation O
screening O
of O
these O
genes O
has O
become O
widespread O
despite O
the O
costs O
involved O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
890 O
and O
975 O
non-protein O
truncating O
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
respectively O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
identify O
causal O
mutations O
due O
to O
the O
large O
number O
of O
variants O
. O

Many O
such O
variants O
may O
appear O
deleterious O
but O
may O
nevertheless O
only O
be O
associated O
with O
disease O
because O
they O
are O
close O
to O
a O
causal O
mutation O
and O
not O
deleterious O
in O
their O
own O
right O
. O

An O
appealing O
strategy O
is O
therefore O
to O
avoid O
the O
large O
number O
of O
comparisons O
required O
to O
test O
each O
variant O
separately O
, O
but O
to O
instead O
use O
methods O
based O
on O
haplotypes O
, O
which O
are O
combinations O
of O
genetic O
variants O
or O
alleles O
( O
typically O
common O
polymorphisms O
) O
inherited O
together O
or O
in O
phase O
from O
a O
single O
parent O
. O

They O
result O
from O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
linkage O
disequilibrium O
( O
LD O
) O
, O
where O
alleles O
at O
closely O
spaced O
markers O
do O
not O
segregate O
independently O
. O

Haplotypes O
can O
capture O
more O
information O
across O
genomic O
regions O
of O
interest O
on O
the O
human B-species
genome O
than O
is O
available O
by O
examining O
single O
genetic O
markers O
one O
at O
a O
time O
however O
the O
generation O
of O
haplotypes O
is O
difficult O
, O
usually O
requiring O
intensive O
laboratory O
efforts O
or O
the O
collection O
and O
genotyping O
of O
several O
closely O
related O
relatives O
to O
infer O
phase O
. O

An O
alternative O
is O
to O
infer O
phase O
from O
genotype O
data O
using O
the O
statistical O
techniques O
that O
have O
been O
developed O
rapidly O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
which O
is O
the O
approach O
adopted O
in O
this O
report O
. O

Haplotypes O
are O
expected O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
fine O
mapping O
of O
complex O
diseases O
since O
disease-affected O
individuals O
with O
common O
haplotypes O
may O
have O
recent O
shared O
ancestry O
of O
chromosomal O
segments O
that O
harbour O
disease-causing O
variants O
. O

By O
identifying O
`` O
disease O
haplotypes O
'' O
that O
are O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
deleterious O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
it O
may O
be O
possible O
to O
identify O
carriers O
implicitly O
rather O
than O
by O
screening O
of O
the O
entire O
gene O
. O

Some O
early O
work O
in O
this O
area O
has O
suggested O
that O
one O
haplotype O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
is O
over-represented O
in O
individuals O
carrying O
deleterious O
mutations O
while O
another O
haplotype O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
20 O
% O
increased O
risk O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

There O
is O
evidence O
that O
this O
scenario O
is O
particularly O
useful O
for O
common O
polymorphisms O
of O
low O
penetrance O
, O
where O
results O
show O
that O
an O
association O
can O
be O
detected O
via O
haplotype O
methods O
using O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
surrounding O
the O
functional O
allele O
even O
if O
the O
functional O
allele O
is O
not O
typed O
. O

We O
explored O
extending O
this O
approach O
to O
detecting O
rare O
deleterious O
mutations O
, O
which O
are O
likely O
to O
have O
arisen O
more O
recently O
and O
occur O
on O
extended O

less O

Discussion O
In O
this O
paper O
we O
used O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
sequence O
data O
from O
Australian O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
less O
than O
40 O
years O
of O
age O
at O
the O
time O
of O
diagnosis O
to O
classify O
individuals O
according O
to O
their O
deleterious O
mutation O
status O
, O
and O
resolved O
haplotypes O
of O
common O
polymorphisms O
separately O
in O
the O
groups O
that O
did O
and O
did O
not O
carry O
deleterious O
mutations O
. O

We O
found O
weak O
evidence O
that O
one O
haplotype O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
variants O
is O
over-represented O
in O
carriers O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
. O

This O
haplotype O
contains O
the O
minor O
allele O
for O
3232A B-mutation
> I-mutation
G I-mutation
variant O
which O
we O
found O
to O
be O
over-represented O
among O
deleterious O
mutation O
carriers O
. O

Other O
haplotypes O
containing O
the O
minor O
allele O
`` O
G O
'' O
also O
occurred O
more O
frequently O
in O
deleterious O
mutation O
group O
. O

In O
BRCA2 B-gene
we O
found O
evidence O
that O
the O
population O
frequency O
of O
the O
most O
common O
haplotype O
in O
individuals O
carrying O
deleterious O
mutations O
was O
greater O
than O
95 O
% O
, O
when O
the O
corresponding O
frequency O
in O
those O
without O
deleterious O
mutations O
was O
only O
65 O
% O
. O

Individuals O
without O
this O
haplotype O
are O
unlikely O
to O
carry O
deleterious O
mutations O
but O
the O
predictive O
power O
of O
this O
haplotype O
for O
deleterious O
mutations O
is O
low O
since O
it O
occurs O
very O
frequently O
in O
those O
with O
no O
deleterious O
mutations O
( O
namely O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
) O
. O

The O
sample O
size O
of O
the O
deleterious O
mutation O
group O
was O
small O
for O
both O
genes O
, O
with O
only O
13 O
and O
11 O
individuals O
carrying O
deleterious O
mutations O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
respectively O
. O

The O
power O
to O
detect O
differences O
in O
haplotype O
frequencies O
is O
therefore O
quite O
low O
, O
which O
might O
explain O
some O
of O
the O
high O
p-values O
obtained O
from O
permutation O
testing O

INTRODUCTION O
The O
most O
significant O
and O
well O
characterized O
genetic O
risk O
factors O
for O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
germline O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
17q O
chromosome O
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
13q O
chromosome O
) O
genes O
. O

Other O
relevant O
genes O
, O
such O
as O
CHEK2 B-gene
, O
NBS1 B-gene
, O
PALB2 B-gene
, O
BRIP1 B-gene
, O
etc. O
, O
also O
contribute O
to O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
although O
their O
impact O
appears O
to O
be O
more O
population-specific O
. O

It O
has O
been O
estimated O
that O
5.0-10.0 O
% O
of O
all O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
10.0-15.0 O
% O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
carry O
mutations O
on O
one O
of O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
. O

The O
prevalence O
of O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
mutation O
carriers O
in O
the O
general O
population O
is O
approximately O
0.2 O
% O
( O
1/500 O
) O
, O
however O
, O
it O
can O
vary O
significantly O
in O
different O
countries O
and O
ethnic O
groups O
due O
to O
founder O
effects O
. O

The O
mutations O
in O
these O
high-penetrance O
genes O
confer O
a O
high O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Women B-species
with O
an O
inherited O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
mutation O
have O
a O
65.0-80.0 O
% O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
37.0-62.0 O
% O
of O
developing O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
over O
their O
lifetime O
, O
while O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
mutation O
carriers O
have O
a O
45.0-85.0 O
% O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
11.0-23.0 O
% O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
identification O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
mutation O
carriers O
is O
therefore O
a O
critical O
step O
in O
individualized O
risk O
assessment O
. O

Once O
a O
mutation O
is O
identified O
in O
a O
given O
family O
, O
a O
very O
informative O
predictive O
( O
or O
presymptomatic O
) O
oncogenetic O
test O
can O
be O
offered O
to O
all O
adult O
family O
members O
. O

Moreover O
, O
oncogenetic O
testing O
is O
becoming O
the O
powerful O
therapeutic O
predictive O
tool O
, O
as O
new O
targeted O
therapeutic O
opportunities O
, O
such O
as O
poly O
( O
ADP-ribose O
) O
( O
PARP O
) O
inhibitors O
emerge O
and O
chemosensitivity O
to O
platinum-based O
therapy O
is O
constantly O
reported O
. O

It O
is O
now O
evident O
that O
in O
the O
near O
future O
the O
demand O
for O
rapid O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
mutation O
testing O
will O
increase O
. O

However O
, O
a O
full O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
screening O
still O
remains O
a O
labor- O
and O
time-consuming O
challenge O
due O
to O
the O
large O
size O
of O
the O
genes O
and O
the O
high O
diversity O
of O
mutations O
and O
variants O
of O
unknown O
significance O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
distribution O
of O
known O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
mutations O
is O
well O
documented O
worldwide O
. O

Several O
recent O
reviews O
have O
summarized O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
mutation O
spectrum O
in O
given O
countries O
and O
ethnic O
communities O
is O
limited O
to O
a O
few O
founder O
mutations O
. O

To O
date O
, O
no O
systematic O
study O
has O
assessed O
the O
distribution O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
mutations O
in O
the O
Macedonian O
population O
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
initiate O
screening O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
gene O
mutations O
in O
order O
to O
identify O
the O
genetic O
variants O
common O
in O
the O
Republic O
of O
Macedonia O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
mutations O
drastically O
increase O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
suggests O
that O
polymorphisms O
in O
these O
genes O
could O
represent O
low O
penetrance O
susceptibility O
alleles O
. O

Whether O
common O
polymorphisms O
contribute O
to O
disease O
risk O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
thoroughly O
evaluated O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
these O
common O
variants O
is O
still O
conflicting O
and O
more O
data O
on O
large O
cohorts O
are O
needed O
to O
better O
understand O
their O
significance O
. O

We O
present O
data O
on O
several O

( O

including O

frequencies O
and O

Bearing O
in O
mind O
that O
certain O

have O
been O
observed O
to O
be O
common O
to O

populations O
, O
we O
designed O
an O
assay O
for O
detection O
of O
the O
most O

in O
the O

Our O
aim O
was O
to O
expand O
the O

breast B-disease
cancer I-disease

To O
this O

, O
we O
developed O
a O

a O
rapid O

for O

We O
screened O

Discussion O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
established O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
a O
group O
of O
698 O
Greek O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
106 O
of O
which O
were O
familial O
cases O
and O
592 O
apparently O
sporadic O
. O

We O
identified O
70 O
pathogenic O
mutations O
in O
all O
( O
10 O
% O
) O
, O
43 O
in O
the O
familial O
cohort O
( O
40.6 O
% O
) O
and O
27 O
in O
the O
sporadic O
cohort O
( O
4.6 O
% O
) O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
such O
study O
in O
the O
Greek O
population O
. O

A O
number O
of O
similar O
studies O
in O
other O
populations O
have O
been O
published O
, O
giving O
prevalence O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
from O
8 O
to O
11 O
% O
. O

Variation O
could O
be O
due O
to O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
, O
mainly O
experimental O
design O
and O
populations O
with O
different O
degrees O
of O
genetic O
heterogeneity O
. O

A O
Canadian O
study O
of O
1342 O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
revealed O
a O
combined O
mutation O
frequency O
of O
13.3 O
% O
of O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
8 O
% O
of O
which O
was O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

In O
another O
study O
11.5 O
% O
of O
all O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
in O
Colombia O
were O
attributable O
to O
a O
single O
BRCA1 B-gene
founder O
mutation O
, O
while O
15.6 O
% O
of O
the O
total O
cohort O
was O
positive O
for O
mutations O
in O
either O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O
5.8 O
% O
of O
a O
population-based O
series O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
in O
Denmark O
were O
also O
found O
to O
be O
positive O
for O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Of O
209 O
women B-species
in O
the O
Tampa O
Bay O
area O
with O
invasive B-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
, O
15.3 O
% O
had O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
9.5 O
% O
of O
which O
was O
due O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
. O

Similarly O
, O
in O
a O
recent O
Australian O
study O
, O
8.8 O
% O
( O
88/1001 O
) O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
tested O
had O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
. O

In O
a O
Polish O
study O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
13.9 O
% O
of O
consecutive O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
11 O
% O
of O
which O
was O
attributable O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

In O
a O
Swedish O
study O
, O
13/161 O
( O
8 O
% O
) O
of O
the O
patients B-species
were O
found O
to O
carry O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
, O
with O
12/13 O
cases O
being O
BRCA1-positive O
. O

Finally O
, O
two O
pioneer O
studies O
using O
next-generation O
sequencing O
techniques O
reported O
an O
18 O
% O
prevalence O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
& O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
11.3 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
) O
mutations O
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
while O
the O
Cancer O
Genome O
Atlas O
( O
TCGA O
) O
Research O
Network O
reported O
14 O
% O
( O
8.5 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
) O
. O

The O
frequency O
of O
10 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
found O
in O
the O
present O
study O
in O
all O
patients B-species
screened O
, O
regardless O
of O
family O
history O
, O
is O
consistent O
with O
previous O
observations O
in O
other O
populations O
. O

Given O
the O
fact O
that O
not O
the O
entire O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
was O
screened O
, O
this O
percentage O
is O
probably O
an O
underestimate O
of O
the O
true O
frequency O
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
in O
our O
population O
. O

We O
estimate O
that O
the O
true O
frequency O
could O
be O
up O
to O
20 O
% O
higher O
, O
as O
in O
85 O
% O
of O
our O
cohort O
( O
592/698 O
patients B-species
) O
screening O
included O
only O
the O
Greek O
founder O
or O
recurrent O
mutations O
, O
representing O
73 O
% O
of O
all O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
observed O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
figure O
, O
we O
support O
the O
recommendation O
of O
at O
least O
BRCA1 B-gene
testing O
for O
all O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
regardless O
of O
family O
history O
and O
age O
of O
diagnosis O
. O

The O
notably O
high O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
our O
familial O
patient B-species
group O
( O
40.6 O
% O
) O
places O
patients B-species
in O
this O
category O
( O

at O

, O
including O
personal O

) O
in O
a O
high-risk O
setting O
, O
making O
screening O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
mandatory O
. O

Previous O
studies O
are O
consistent O
with O
this O
observation O
and O

, O
reporting O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
prevalence O
in O

that O

ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
over O

This O
study O
also O
showed O
that O
the O
most O

is O
high-grade O

lesions O
of O
ovarian B-disease

in O
BRCA1 B-gene

have O
suggested O
that O
the O
primary O
origin O

is O
the O

Further O

the O

by O

Nowadays O
, O
genetic O

is O
offered O
primarily O
to O
patients B-species
with O
early O

breast/ovarian B-disease

( O

or O
when O

and O
it O
primarily O

. O

Clinical O
intervention O
strategies O
are O
offered O
to O

that O
will O
dramatically O
reduce O

. O

The O
most O
effective O
preventive O
measure O
today O
for O
ovarian B-disease
and I-disease
fallopian I-disease

cancer I-disease
, O
is O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
by O
the O
age O
of O
40 O
years O
and O
after O
completion O
of O

. O

Unfortunately O
, O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
surveillance O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
proven O
effective O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
48.3 O
% O
of O
familial O
patients B-species
with O
breast/ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
that O
carry O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
have O
a O
family O
history O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
45.8 O
% O
of O
breast/ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
with O
inherited O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
do O
not O
have O
a O
clear O
family O
history O
due O
to O
a O
small O
family O
structure O
, O
predominance O
of O
males O
in O
the O
family O
and/or O
paternal O
inheritance O
, O
adoption O
or O
non-biological O
father O
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
in O
these O
families O
are O
at O
the O
same O
risk O
level O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
as O
women B-species
from O
high-incidence O
families O
. O

At O
present O
, O
women B-species
from O
such O
families O
rarely O
use O
genetic O
services O
. O

There O
is O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O
the O
percentage O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
in O
patients B-species
with O
breast/ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
those O
without O
a O

history O
. O

This O
further O
supports O
what O
is O
highlighted O
by O
all O
recent O
mutation O
prevalence O
studies O
, O
including O
the O
present O
one O
, O
that O
all O
women B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
, I-disease
fallopian I-disease
tube I-disease
, I-disease
or I-disease
peritoneal I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
should O
undergo O
comprehensive O
genetic O
testing O
, O
regardless O
of O
age O
or O
family O
history O
. O

However O
, O
the O
screening O
strategy O
being O
employed O
until O
now O
, O
testing O
one O
gene O
at O
a O
time O
is O
costly O
, O
laborious O
and O
time-consuming O
. O

Analysing O
first O
the O
most O
commonly O
mutated O
regions O
in O
each O
population O
, O
provides O
a O
population-specific O
, O
cost-effective O
way O
for O
testing O
hereditary B-disease
breast/ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
for O
mutations O
in O
predisposing O
genes O
. O

This O
study O
provides O
a O
fast O
protocol O
, O
for O
testing O
all O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
in O
Greece O
for O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
. O

Massively O
parallel O
sequencing O
is O
now O
being O
used O
in O
order O
to O
sequence O
many O
genes O
simultaneously O
at O
low O
cost O
. O

It O
has O
now O
emerged O
that O
more O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
carry O
cancer-predisposing O
mutations O
and O
in O
more O
genes O
than O
previously O
appreciated O
. O

Recent O
studies O
using O
next-generation O
sequencing O
technologies O
have O
identified O
more O
than O
12 O
low-to-medium O
penetrance O
novel O
susceptibility O
genes O
that O
might O
predispose O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
but O
their O
exact O
prevalence O
is O
still O
under O
investigation O
. O

Thus O
, O
inherited B-disease
breast/ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
genetically O
highly O
heterogeneous O
with O
respect O
to O
both O
genetic O
loci O
and O
alleles O
involved O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
despite O
mutations O
in O
cancer O
predisposing O
genes O
there O
are O
also O
a O
number O
of O
other O
molecular O
aberrations O
that O
cause O

up O

30 O
% O

in O

are O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
by O
some O
authors O
that O
screening O
for O
founder O
mutations O
should O
be O
undertaken O
in O
all O
Brazilian O
women B-species
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
prevalence O
of O
three O
founder O
mutations O
, O
commonly O
identified O
in O
Ashkenazi O
individuals O
in O
a O
sample O
of O
non-Ashkenazi O
cancer-affected O
Brazilian O
women B-species

clearly O
defined O

factors O
for O
hereditary B-disease

( I-disease

. O

Among O
137 O
unrelated O
Brazilian O
women B-species
from O

families O
, O
the O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
mutation O
was O
identified O
in O
seven O
individuals O
( O
5 O

) O
. O

This O
prevalence O
is O
similar O
to O
that O
encountered O
in O
non-Ashkenazi O
HBOC B-disease
families O
in O
other O
populations O
. O

However O
, O
among O
patients B-species
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
frequency O
of O
c.5266dup B-mutation
was O
significantly O
higher O
when O
compared O
to O
patients B-species

unilateral B-disease

( O
12.1 O

The O

We O
conclude O
that O
screening O
non-Ashkenazi O
breast B-disease
cancer-affected O
women B-species
from O
the O
ethnically O
heterogeneous O
Brazilian O
populations O
for O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
c.68_69del B-mutation
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
c.5946del B-mutation
is O
not O
justified O
, O
and O
that O
screening O
for O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
high O
risk O
patients B-species
, O
given O
its O
prevalence O
as O
a O
single O
mutation O
. O

In O
high-risk O

, O
a O
negative O
screening O
result O
should O
always O
be O
followed O
by O
comprehensive O
BRCA B-gene

. O

The O

frequency O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene

in O

as O
well O
as O
existence O
of O
other O

Introduction O
Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
non-cutaneous O
malignancy O
in O
Brazilian O
women B-species
of O
all O
ages O
. O

In O
the O
Southern O
and O
Southeastern O
States O
of O
Brazil O
, O
the O
estimated O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
incidence O
rates O
for O
2010 O
reached O
64.54 O
and O
64.30 O
per O
100,000 O
women B-species
, O
the O
highest O
in O
the O
country O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
continuous O
efforts O
to O
improve O
early O
detection O
and O
treatment O
, O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
remains O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
deaths O
by O
cancer O
in O
Brazilian O
women B-species
. O

Furthermore O
, O
mortality O
rates O
by O
this O
type O
of O
cancer O
are O
still O
increasing O
in O
the O
Southern O
States O
of O
the O
country O
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
5-10 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
are O
hereditary O
, O
arising O
from O
highly O
penetrant O
germline O
mutations O
in O
cancer O
predisposition O
genes O
. O

A O
significant O
proportion O
of O
individuals O
with O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
have O
mutations O
in O
the O
tumor O
suppressor O
genes O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
OMIM O
# O
113705 O
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
OMIM O
# O
600185 O
) O
. O

Carriers O
of O
such O
mutations O
are O
usually O
predisposed O
to O
breast B-disease
, I-disease
ovarian I-disease
, I-disease
prostate I-disease
and I-disease
other I-disease
cancers I-disease
at O
an O
early O
age O
, O
a O
syndrome O
known O
as O
Hereditary B-disease
Breast I-disease
and I-disease
Ovarian I-disease
Cancer I-disease
( O
HBOC B-disease
) O
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
similar O
in O
their O
structure O
and O
quite O
large O
( O
100 O
and O
70 O
kb O
, O
respectively O
) O
. O

Germline O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
are O
usually O
point O
mutations O
, O
and O
are O
scattered O
along O
their O
entire O
coding O
sequences O
; O
mutational O
hot-spots O
are O
uncommon O
. O

Deleterious O
gene O
rearrangements O
may O
also O
occur O
in O
up O
to O
30 O
% O
of O
the O
cases O
. O

Therefore O
, O
full O
gene O
sequencing O
and O
rearrangement O
testing O
is O
warranted O
for O
accurate O
diagnosis O
in O
most O
individuals O
. O

In O
a O
few O
populations O
, O
however O
, O
founder O
mutations O
have O
been O
described O
and O
are O
responsible O
for O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
the O
mutation-positive O
diagnoses O
. O

This O
is O
the O
case O
for O
the O

in O
10-12 O
% O
of O
Ashkenazi O

BRCA B-gene

have O
also O
been O

and O
German O
populations O
( O

. O

In O
these O
populations O
, O
initial O
screening O
of O
a O
clinically O
suspicious O
case O
by O
testing O
for O
founder O
mutations O
is O
acceptable O

allows O
the O

Discussion O
The O
identification O
of O
individuals O
at-risk O
for O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
important O
to O
ensure O
that O
appropriate O
risk O
reducing O
interventions O
are O
offered O
, O
to O
counsel O
patients B-species
and O
families O
regarding O
recurrence O
risk O
and O
to O
guide O
the O
decisions O
about O
cancer O
treatment O
interventions O
in O
affected O
individuals O
. O

The O
precise O
identification O
of O
at-risk O
individuals O
in O
a O
given O
family O
depends O
on O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
deleterious O
germline O
mutation O
in O
a O
cancer O
predisposition O
gene O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
HBOC B-disease
syndrome I-disease
, O
genetic O
testing O
is O
often O
hampered O
by O
the O
complexity O
and O
cost O
of O
testing O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
, O
especially O
in O
lower O
resource O
countries O
. O

In O
Brazil O
, O
such O
testing O
is O
not O
yet O
covered O
by O
private O
insurance O
nor O
provided O
by O
the O
public O
health O
care O
system O
and O
its O
cost O
in O
private O
laboratories O
precludes O
its O
use O
for O
most O
at-risk O
families O
. O

The O
initial O
screening O
of O
founder O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
before O
investigation O
of O
their O
entire O
coding O
regions O
has O
been O
well O
established O
in O
individuals O
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
ancestry O
as O
well O
as O
in O
a O
few O
other O
populations O
, O
and O
it O
is O
considered O
a O
cost-effective O
approach O
in O
these O
populations O
. O

In O
other O
Latin O
American O
communities O
, O
this O
issue O
has O
not O
been O
largely O
explored O
. O

An O
exception O
is O
a O
large O
cohort O
of O
Latin O
American O
HBOC B-disease
families O
studied O
by O
Weitzel O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2005 O
) O
in O
which O
six O
recurrent O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
accounted O
for O
47 O
% O
of O
the O
deleterious O
germline O
mutations O
and O
interestingly O
, O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
c.68_69del B-mutation
mutation O
, O
one O
of O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
, O
occurred O
in O
3.6 O
% O
of O
this O
clinic-based O
cohort O
of O
predominantly O
Mexican O
women B-species
. O

In O
this O
study O
the O
authors O
suggest O
that O
an O
initial O
diagnostic O
screen O
with O
a O
panel O
for O
these O
more O
commonly O
observed O
mutations O
could O
be O
cost-effective O
. O

Only O
two O
reports O
from O
Brazilian O
breast-cancer B-disease
affected O
patients B-species
have O
suggested O
that O
a O
founder O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
, O
c.5266dup B-mutation
, O
may O
be O
encountered O
at O
a O
significant O
prevalence O
. O

This O
mutation O
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
mutation O
described O
in O
the O
Breast O
Cancer O
Information O
Core O
( O

It O

It O
was O

in O
a O
recent O
study O
from O
Portugal O
, O
where O
it O
appeared O
in O
approximately O
1.0 O

of O
the O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O
a O
recent O
multi-national O
study O
, O
Hamel O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2011 O
) O
identified O
this O
mutation O
in O
several O
European O
countries O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
it O
has O
not O
been O
detected O
in O
Spain O
nor O
in O
other O
South O
American O
countries O
, O
although O
only O
a O
few O
comprehensive O
mutation O
studies O
( O
i.e O

including O
sequencing O
of O
the O
entire O
coding O
region O
of O
both O
genes O
and O
gene O
rearrangement O
testing O
) O
in O
HBOC B-disease
families O
have O
been O
produced O
in O
these O
regions O
. O

The O
penetrance O
of O
the O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
mutation O
has O
been O
well O
defined O
in O
Ashkenazi O
women B-species
, O
being O
associated O
with O
a O
cumulative O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
0.67 O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
0.33 O
for O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
, O
we O
screened O
137 O
unrelated O
and O
self-referred O
non-Ashkenazi O
women B-species
at O
high O
risk O
for O
the O
HBOC B-disease
syndrome I-disease
for O
the O
three O
common O
founder O
mutations O
described O
in O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
cohorts O
and O
only O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
was O
identified O
, O
at O
a O
frequency O
of O
5.0 O
% O
. O

As O
expected O
, O
this O
frequency O
is O
higher O
than O
that O
described O
by O
the O
other O
Brazilian O
studies O
, O
including O
that O
of O
Gomes O
et O
al O
. O
and O
Esteves O
et O
al O
, O
and O
likely O
results O
from O
the O
study O
design O
, O
that O
defined O
a O
significant O
personal O
and O
familial O
cancer O
history O
as O
inclusion O
criterion O
at O
recruitment O
. O

Our O
results O
are O
in O
agreement O
with O
previous O
prevalence O
studies O
of O
the O
c.5266dup B-mutation
mutation O
in O
other O
high-risk O
non-Ashkenazi O
populations O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Italian O
and O
German O
populations O
. O

The O
origin O
of O
the O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
mutation O
in O
Brazilian O
patients B-species
and O
its O
relation O
to O
the O
Eastern-European O
counterpart O
remain O
to O
be O
determined O
. O

In O
a O
recently O
published O
study O
, O
da O
Costa O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2008 O
) O
evaluated O
the O
haplotypic O
profile O
of O
seven O
Brazilian O
carriers O
of O
c.5266dup B-mutation
and O
reported O
that O
all O
mutation O
carriers O
shared O
an O
identical O
haplotype O
, O
indicating O
a O
common O
origin O
. O

Some O
authors O
( O
i.e O
. O

Carvalho O
Silva O
et O
al O
. O
and O
Gomes O
et O
al O
. O
) O
have O
postulated O
that O
the O
entry O
of O
this O
mutation O
into O
Brazil O
is O
related O
to O
immigration O
of O
European O
Jews O
from O
Portugal O
in O
the O
sixteenth O
century O
. O

In O
the O
report O
by O
Weitzel O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2005 O
) O
, O
that O
identified O
the O
Ashkenazi O
founder O
mutation O
c.68_69del B-mutation
in O
Mexican O
HBOC B-disease
families O
, O
all O
mutation O
carriers O
shared O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
founder O
haplotype O
. O

The O
authors O
postulate O
that O
Mexican O
carriers O
of O
these O
mutations O
are O
likely O
descendants O
of O
Conversos O
who O
immigrated O
to O
the O
Americas O
in O
the O
15th-16th O
centuries O
and O
over O
generations O
assimilated O
into O
the O
larger O
Hispanic O
society O
. O

The O
same O
reasoning O
may O
be O
applied O
to O
the O
occurrence O
of O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
in O
Brazil O
. O

However O
, O
the O
absence O
of O
this O
mutation O
in O
studies O
from O
Spain O
or O
from O
other O
South O
American O
countries O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
one O
case O
was O
reported O
in O
Portugal O
is O
against O
this O
hypothesis O
. O

Recent O
results O
from O
the O
study O
of O
Hamel O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2011 O
) O
, O
show O
that O
the O
mutation O
probably O
originated O
in O
Scandinavia O
or O
Northern O
Russia O
, O
was O
then O
disseminated O
in O
European O
populations O
and O
thus O
could O
have O
entered O
Brazil O
through O
one O
or O
more O
of O
the O
several O
large O
European O
immigration O
waves O
in O
the O
18th O
and O
19th O
centuries O
. O

A O
detailed O
understanding O
of O
its O
entrance O
and O
distribution O
in O
Brazil O
, O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
. O

One O
interesting O
finding O
of O
our O
study O
is O
the O
high O
frequency O
of O
the O
c.5266dup B-mutation
mutation O
in O
patients B-species
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
unilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
women B-species
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
more O
likely O
to O
carry O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
. O

Gershoni-Baruch O
et O
al O
. O
( O
1999 O
) O
, O
studying O
Jewish O
women B-species
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
found O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
founder O
mutations O
( O
31.0 O
% O
) O
, O
and O
3.7 O
% O
of O
the O
cases O
carried O
the O
c.5266dup B-mutation
mutation O
. O

In O
their O
report O
, O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
per O
se O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
reflect O
genetic O
predisposition O
unless O
associated O
with O
early O
age O
of O
onset O
. O

In O
another O
study O
that O
compared O
mutation O
prevalence O
in O
women B-species
with O
unilateral O
, O
family O
history O
positive O
and O
early O
onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
women B-species
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
distribution O
of O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
was O
not O
significantly O
different O
between O
groups O
. O

A O
limitation O
of O
our O
study O
is O
that O
we O
have O
not O
investigated O
the O
potential O
existence O
of O
other O
founder O
mutations O
that O
could O
become O
apparent O
after O
gene O
full O
gene O
sequencing O
; O
however O
, O
there O
is O
currently O
no O
published O
evidence O
for O
Brazilian O
BRCA B-gene
founder O
mutations O
other O
than O
c.5266dup B-mutation
. O

We O
did O
not O
consider O
testing O
for O
founders O
described O
in O
Hispanic O
populations O
( O
i.e O
. O

Weitzel O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2005 O
) O
; O
Rodriguez O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2008 O
) O
) O
since O
it O
is O
our O
understanding O
that O
the O
population O
from O
the O
Brazilian O
cities O
studied O
here O
show O
trihybrid O
ancestries O
that O
are O
distinct O
from O
the O
Central O
American O
populations O
as O
indicated O
by O
studies O
from O
Alves-Silva O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2000 O
) O
and O
Parra O
et O
al O
. O
( O
2003 O
) O
. O

Additionally O
, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
clearly O
that O
even O
mestizos O
from O
different O
Central O
and O
South O
American O
regions O
have O
significant O
intra- O
and O
interethnic O
variability O
and O
admixture O
profiles O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
debatable O
point O
regarding O
founder O
mutation O
frequency O
in O
a O
given O
population O
or O
high O
risk O
group O
, O
is O
how O
much O
is O
enough O
to O
justify O
screening O
. O

Although O
the O
economic O
analysis O
of O
such O
a O
question O
is O
beyond O
the O
scope O
of O
our O
study O
, O
there O
must O
be O
also O
a O
concern O
with O
the O
social O
and O
medical O
consequences O
of O
such O
testing O
. O

Given O
current O
knowledge O
, O
if O
a O
recommendation O
for O
screening O
of O
founder O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
is O
made O
for O
Brazilian O
HBOC B-disease
women B-species
without O
subsequent O
comprehensive O
testing O
, O
most O
( O
likely O
> O
90 O
% O
) O
of O
the O
mutations O
carriers O
would O
remain O
unidentified O
. O

Such O
a O
recommendation O
could O
be O
erroneously O
interpreted O
as O
sufficient O
, O
or O
result O
in O
false O
tranquilization O
whenever O
negative O
, O
hampering O
continuation O
towards O
mutation O
testing O
of O
the O
entire O
coding O
region O
of O
both O
genes O
, O
which O
could O
obviously O
have O
serious O
consequences O
for O
these O
individuals O
and O
their O
families O
. O

This O
concern O
is O
further O
justified O
by O
the O
inaccessibility O
to O
proper O
cancer O
genetic O
counseling O
for O
most O
high-risk O
Brazilian O
women B-species
, O
and O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
coverage O
through O
both O
private O
and O
public O
health-based O
insurance O
of O
germline O
mutation O
testing O
. O

Thus O
, O
although O
the O
frequency O
of O
one O
single O
mutation O
, O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
is O
significant O
in O
this O
subset O
of O
Brazilian O
women B-species
with O
a O
personal O
and O
familial O
history O
of O
HBOC B-disease
, O
initial O
screening O
for O
one O
founder O
mutation O
in O
at-risk O
patients B-species
should O
be O
performed O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
within O
a O
cancer O
risk O
evaluation O
program O
. O

In O
a O
high-risk O
patient B-species
or O
family O
, O
testing O
should O
always O
include O
a O
comprehensive O
approach O
( O
full O
gene O
sequencing O
and O
rearrangement O
testing O
for O
both O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
) O
when O
the O
initial O
founder O
mutation O
screening O
is O
negative O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
initial O
screening O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
c.5266dup B-mutation
mutation O
in O
Brazilian O
individuals O
at O
high O
risk O
for O
HBOC B-disease
is O
justified O
, O
but O
should O
be O
considered O
with O
caution O
. O

This O
statement O
is O
based O
on O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
single O
founder O
mutation O
currently O
described O
in O
this O
population O
, O
lack O
of O
evidence O
of O
other O
founder O
BRCA B-gene
mutants O
at O
a O
significant O
frequency O
in O
Brazil O
, O
and O
potential O
consequences O
of O
misinterpretation O
of O
negative O
screening O
results O
. O

These O
principles O
may O
apply O
to O
other O
highly O
admixed O
populations O
in O
South O
America O
and O
other O
continents O
. O

It O
is O
imperative O
to O
concentrate O
efforts O
in O
making O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
testing O
and O
genetic O
counseling O
available O
to O
all O
high-risk O
patients B-species
in O
Brazil O
, O
and O
in O
educating O
health O
care O
professionals O
in O
the O
identification O
and O
proper O
management O
of O
these O
individuals O
. O

The O
best O
strategy O
for O
mutation O
screening O
and O
molecular O
diagnosis O
of O
high O
risk O
HBOC B-disease
families O
in O
Brazil O
will O
only O
be O
fully O
understood O
after O
a O
comprehensive O
knowledge O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
types O
and O
frequencies O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
two O
of O
the O
seven O
mutation-positive O
individuals O
had O
a O
limited O
family O
structure O
reinforce O
the O
importance O
of O
recognizing O
this O
feature O
and O
demonstrate O
that O
criteria O
for O
genetic O
testing O
must O
be O
adapted O
to O
consider O
this O
variable O
. O

The O
increased O
frequency O
of O
BRCA1c.5266dup O
in O
women B-species
with O
bilateral B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
should O
be O
further O

Women B-species

The O

To O

Currently O

are O
considered O
to O
be O
at O

and O
are O
closely O

It O
would O
be O
important O
to O
determine O
whether O
or O

there O
is O
a O
genotype-phenotype O

that O
can O
assist O
in O
identifying O
BRCA B-gene

that O
are O
at O
low O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
5 O

mutations O
in O

a O
lower O
risk O
of O

mutations O

We O
thus O
sought O
to O
determine O
the O
mutation O
position O
in O
BRCA-associated O
breast B-disease

at O
our O
institution O
. O

We O
found O
that O

over O
a O
third O
of O
BRCA2-associated O

The O
effect O

In O

that O

Lubinski O

that O

more O

Risch O

reported O
that O
for O

there O
is O
a O

For O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
an O
increased O

associated O
with O
mutations O
outside O
of O
the O
`` O
ovarian B-disease

'' O
( O
OCCR O

. O

These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
patients B-species

5 O

BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
and O
BRCA B-gene
OCCR O
mutations O
may O
not O
be O

as O
currently O
thought O
. O

However O
, O
it O
would O
be O
critical O
to O
validate O
these O
results O
, O
and O
determine O
if O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
location O
can O
indeed O
be O
used O
for O
further O
risk O

. O

We O
found O
that O
over O

BRCA1-associated O
breast B-disease

over O
a O
third O
of O
BRCA2-associated O

were O
associated O
with O
putative O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
even O
these O
lower O
risk O
regions O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
BRCA-associated O
breast B-disease

and O
argue O
against O
using O
genotype O

counseling O
in O
the O
absence O
of O

tools O
. O

However O
, O
we O
already O
have O
some O
additional O
clinical-pathologic O
information O
that O
can O
be O
used O
for O
risk O
counseling O
in O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O

. O

A O
rapid O
decrease O
in O
the O
relative O
risk O
of O
BRCA-associated O
breast B-disease

is O
noted O
with O
increasing O
age O
. O

Family O
history O
is O
important O
even O
among O

; O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
is O
higher O
among O
first-degree O
relatives O
of O
probands B-species
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
rather O
than O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Furthermore O
, O
an O
oophorectomy O
not O
only O
decreases O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
but O
also O
significantly O
decreases O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

However O
, O
further O
risk O
stratification O
among O
BRCA B-gene

is O
still O
necessary O
. O

Along O
these O
lines O
, O
major O
effort O

been O
made O
into O
identifying O
other O
genetic O
modifiers O
of O
breast B-disease

It O
is O

we O
will O

predict O
an O

several O
limitations O

First O
, O
it O
is O
of O
a O
limited O
sample O

to O
our O

, O
we O
focused O

Second O
, O
it O

more O

Third O
, O
we O

be O

in O

Our O

In O
conclusion O

we O
sought O

the O

We O

the O

Discussion O
This O
study O
has O
updated O
the O
previous O
comprehensive O
analysis O
of O
FH O
and O
mutation O
analysis O
for O
all O
three O
high-risk O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
genes O
in O
women B-species
diagnosed O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
aged O
< O
=30 O
years O
to O
include O
an O
additional O
15 O
patients B-species
with O
5 O
new O
pathogenic O
mutations O
. O

The O
analysis O
of O
contralateral O
disease O
, O
non-breast O
primaries O
and O
survival O
has O
been O
enriched O
with O
additional O
patients B-species
diagnosed O
at O
the O
age O
of O
< O
=30 O
years O
from O
our O
mutation O
database O
. O

We O
have O
previously O
published O
the O
prevalence O
of O
both O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
and O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
in O
this O
cohort O
( O
Lalloo O
et O
al O
, O
2003 O
) O
, O
demonstrating O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
than O
previously O
expected O
. O

The O
mutation O
detection O
rate O
in O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
these O
three O
genes O
is O
~50 O
% O
( O
26 O
of O
53 O
) O
, O
demonstrating O
the O
importance O
of O
accurately O
documenting O
a O
FH O
when O
estimating O
the O
likelihood O
of O
a O
mutation O
carrier O
. O

Few O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
those O
women B-species
without O
a O
FH O
. O

These O
data O
would O
therefore O
not O
support O
the O
testing O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
in O
patients B-species
below O
the O
age O
of O
31 O
years O
without O
a O
FH O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
particular O
, O
even O
in O
sporadic O
cases O
with O
grade O
3 O
cancers O
, O
the O
detection O
rate O
was O
only O
5 O
% O
. O

Among O
grade O
3 O
triple-negative O
sporadic O
cases O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
mutation O
detection O
was O
only O
12.5 O
% O
( O
2 O
of O
16 O
) O
. O

Lakhani O
et O
al O
( O
2005 O
) O
reported O
data O
on O
the O
likelihood O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
being O
caused O
by O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
by O
pathological O
grade O
and O
ER O
status O
at O
various O
ages O
in O
women B-species
not O
selected O
by O
FH O
. O

These O
data O
were O
also O
from O
an O
unselected O
series O
. O

Women B-species
aged O
between O
20 O
and O
29 O
years O
with O
grade O
3 O
ER-negative B-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
had O
a O
35 O
% O
chance O
of O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
, O
with O
a O
similarly O
high O
risk O
for O
women B-species
aged O
30-34 O
years O
at O
26.5 O
% O
. O

Only O
after O
the O
age O
of O
34 O
years O
did O
the O
risks O
fall O
below O
10 O
% O
( O
Lakhani O
et O
al O
, O
2005 O
) O
. O

However O
, O
these O
figures O
include O
all O
women B-species
, O
even O
those O
with O
a O
FH O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
some O
clinicians O
have O
misinterpreted O
these O
data O
and O
called O
for O
all O
women B-species
< O
35 O
years O
of O
age O
with O
pathological O
grade O
3 O
and O
ER-negative B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
to O
be O
tested O
, O
or O
has O
offered O
testing O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
10-20 O
% O
testing O
threshold O
. O

Our O
population-based O
data O
confirm O
a O
similar O
29 O
% O
risk O
for O
young O
women B-species
( O
age O
< O
31 O
years O
) O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
only O
triple-negative B-disease
, I-disease
pathological I-disease
grade I-disease
3 I-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
in O
women B-species
< O
31 O
years O
of O
age O
qualify O
for O
testing O
, O
irrespective O
of O
FH O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
guidelines O
using O
a O
10 O
% O
threshold O
in O
outbred O
populations O
. O

Clearly O
, O
the O
CIs O
are O
wide O
on O
these O
numbers O
, O
and O
further O
studies O
to O
assess O
the O
rates O
of O
mutations O
in O
sporadic O
triple-negative O
patients B-species
will O
help O
inform O
models O
and O
scoring O
systems O
further O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a O
recent O
North O
American O
study O
demonstrated O
mutations O
in O
9 O
% O
of O
triple-negative B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
aged O
< O
40 O
years O
without O
, O
or O
with O
minimal O
, O
FH O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
Young O
et O
al O
, O
2009 O
) O
. O

However O
, O
this O
study O
did O
not O
describe O
the O
FH O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
use O
of O
pathology O
in O
our O
pathology-adjusted O
Manchester O
score O
( O
Evans O
et O
al O
, O
2009 O
) O
improved O
sensitivity O
at O
the O
20 O
% O
threshold O
by O
detecting O
two O
further O
mutations O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
testing O
only O
three O
further O
samples O
. O

The O
data O
in O
the O
current O
analysis O
demonstrate O
the O
improvement O
in O
survival O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
which O
is O
seen O
in O
many O
countries O
. O

In O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
, O
a O
more O
formal O
approach O
for O
breast O
surgery O
including O
axillary O
node O
dissection O
and O
treatment O
of O
all O
ipsilateral O
breast O
tissue O
( O
radiotherapy O
in O
those O
undergoing O
local O
excision O
) O
was O
highlighted O
in O
1990 O
( O
Fentiman O
and O
Mansel O
, O
1991 O
) O
. O

This O
more O
formalised O
treatment O
schedule O
may O
in O
part O
explain O
the O
significant O
improvement O
in O
survival O
from O
diagnosis O
with O
time O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
overall O
survival O
is O
still O
poor O
in O
this O
group O
of O
young O
women B-species
. O

This O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
related O
to O
a O
more O
aggressive O
phenotype O
with O
less O
hormonally O
sensitive O
cancers O
( O
Figueiredo O
et O
al O
, O
2007 O
; O
Anders O
et O
al O
, O
2008 O
) O
. O

The O
poor O
prognosis O
seems O
to O
particularly O
apply O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
at O
age O
< O
35 O
years O
and O
is O
consistent O
between O
studies O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
, O
North O
America O
and O
Asia O
( O
Nixon O
et O
al O
, O
1994 O
; O
Jmor O
et O

; O
Han O
and O
Kang O
, O
2010 O
) O
. O

The O
diagnosis O
of O
a O
second O
primary O
tumour O
should O
prompt O
the O
clinician O
to O
consider O
a O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
. O

One O
patient B-species
with O
a O
renal B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
and O
a O
de O
novo O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
went O
on O
to O
develop O
a O
sarcoma B-disease
behind O
the O
remaining O
kidney O
that O
was O
subjected O
to O
regular O
screening O
radiation O
from O
intravenous O
urograms O
. O

An O
oesophageal B-disease
cancer I-disease
also O
occurred O
in O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
carrier O
. O

However O
, O
surprisingly O
, O
no O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
occurred O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
even O
though O
21 O
women B-species
have O
lived O
beyond O
40 O
years O
of O
age O
without O
an O
oophorectomy O
. O

Population O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
subsequent O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
is O
higher O
if O
an O
individual O
is O
diagnosed O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
a O
young O
age O
, O
particularly O
if O
there O
is O
a O
FH O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
Bergfeldt O
et O
al O
, O
2002 O
) O
. O

This O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
suggest O
a O
high O
probability O
of O
a O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
rather O
than O
another O
mechanism O
increasing O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

The O
data O
from O
our O
study O
do O
not O
suggest O
a O
higher O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
women B-species
with O
known O
mutations O
with O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
compared O
with O
mutation O
carriers O
with O
later-onset O
disease O
. O

This O
study O
assessed O
the O
performance O
of O
mutation O
prediction O
models O
in O
this O
population-based O
data O
set O
. O

We O
chose O
to O
assess O
the O
models O
at O
last O
follow-up O
to O
determine O
how O
the O
models O
dealt O
with O
new O
contralateral O
disease O
. O

Direct O
comparisons O
with O
the O
Manchester O
scoring O
system O
are O
inappropriate O
, O
as O
this O
system O
was O
partly O
developed O
from O
the O
original O
data O
set O
at O
the O
time O
of O
diagnosis O
. O

Another O
model O
, O
BOADICEA O
, O
also O
used O
this O
data O
set O
in O
development O
( O
Antoniou O
et O

, O
2008 O
) O
. O

BRCAPRO O
( O
Parmigiani O
et O
al O
, O
1998 O
) O
performs O
well O
, O
especially O
in O
unilateral O
cases O
. O

As O
no O
non-Jewish O
sporadic O
case O
( O
even O
the O
adopted O
individuals O
) O
reached O
the O
10 O
% O
combined O
threshold O
even O
at O
the O
time O
of O
diagnosis O
, O
this O
supports O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
, O
in O
Western O
populations O
, O
the O
rates O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
even O
in O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
without O
a O
FH O
are O
low O
. O

An O
adopted O
sporadic O
case O
would O
need O
to O
be O
diagnosed O
at O
the O
age O
of O
< O
=24 O
years O
to O
breach O
the O
threshold O
using O
BRCAPRO O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
BRCAPRO O
does O
seem O
to O
overestimate O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
probabilities O
in O
bilateral O
cases O
. O

It O
is O
also O
interesting O
to O
note O
the O
handling O
of O
DCIS B-disease
. O

Although O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
with O
DCIS B-disease
were O
identified O
using O
the O
10 O
% O
combined O
threshold O
, O
they O
were O
as O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
carrier O
as O
an O
unaffected O
sibling O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
no O
weight O
is O
given O
to O
DCIS B-disease
to O
increase O
either O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
probability O
of O
either O
the O
individual O
or O
the O
family O
in O
BRCAPRO O
. O

Ductal B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
in I-disease
situ I-disease
at O
the O
age O
of O
< O
=30 O
years O
is O
clearly O
an O
important O
diagnosis O
, O
as O
45 O
% O
of O
the O
11 O
cases O
had O
a O
pathogenic O
mutation O
, O
with O
DCIS B-disease
being O
a O
particular O
marker O
for O
a O
TP53 B-gene
mutation O
. O

The O
myriad O
tables O
( O
Frank O
et O
al O
, O
2002 O
) O
do O
not O
have O
a O
specific O
readout O
for O
bilateral O
disease O
and O
therefore O
should O
probably O
not O
be O
used O
to O
assess O
families O
with O
this O
disease O
. O

No O
patient B-species
using O
the O
Myriad O
tables O
had O
a O
score O
above O
39.2 O
% O
for O
likelihood O
of O
a O
mutation O
. O

There O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
degree O
of O
overestimation O
at O
the O
top O
end O
of O
the O
BRCAPRO O
model O
. O

The O
model O
does O
not O
allow O
for O
sensitivity O
of O
mutation O
techniques O
, O
as O
scores O
of O
up O
to O
100 O
% O
are O
possible O
. O

The O
model O
also O
does O
not O
allow O
for O
the O
possibility O
of O
other O
high-penetrance O
genes O
, O
as O
two O
of O
the O
TP53 B-gene
carriers O
had O
scores O
above O
94 O
% O
, O
yet O
their O
FHs O
were O
consistent O
with O
LFS B-disease
. O

We O
have O
estimated O
that O
a O
combined O
score O
of O
40+ O
using O
the O
Manchester O
score O
suggests O
a O
very O
high O
probability O
of O
a O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
( O
Evans O
et O
al O
, O
2009 O
) O
. O

Using O
this O
threshold O
, O
six O
of O
seven O
samples O
had O
a O
detectable O
mutation O
. O

The O
strengths O
of O
this O
study O
are O
that O
it O
is O
population O
based O
and O
has O
obtained O
DNA O
samples O
on O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
living O
cases O
. O

Overall O
death O
rates O
and O
second O
primary O
rates O
are O
secure O
because O
of O
the O
cancer O
intelligence O
service O
. O

This O
study O
does O
have O
some O
limitations O
. O

The O
pathology O
reports O
on O
patients B-species
diagnosed O
before O
1990 O
had O
little O
information O
with O
regard O
to O
grade O
and O
do O
not O
have O
information O
regarding O
hormone O
receptor O
status O
. O

It O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
determine O
reliable O
survival O
data O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
tumour O
grade O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
deficiency O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
group O
that O
submitted O
a O

sample O
, O
a O
detailed O
pathological O
review O
was O
possible O
in O
most O
cases O
. O

Summary O
This O

has O
shown O
an O
improvement O
in O

for O
women B-species

Among O

INTRODUCTION O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
have O
been O
found O
in O
women B-species
from O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
backgrounds O
. O

These O
genetic O
mutations O
are O
inherited O
in O
an O
autosomal O
dominant O
fashion O
and O
significantly O
increase O
risk O
of O
both O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
epithelial I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Women B-species
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
have O
a O
lifetime O
probability O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
of O
65-81 O
% O
and O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
of O
up O
to O
35-60 O
% O
, O
while O
women B-species
carrying O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
have O
a O
45-85 O
% O
chance O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
a O
10-27 O
% O
chance O
of O
developing O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

BRCA B-gene
mutations O
also O
predispose O
to O
melanoma B-disease
, O
prostate B-disease
and I-disease
pancreatic I-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

While O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
responsible O
for O
a O
minority O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
they O
are O
found O
in O
as O
many O
as O
5-10 O
% O
of O
patients B-species
with O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
epithelial I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

Chemoprevention O
and O
prophylactic O
surgery O
( O
bilateral O
mastectomy O
and O
bilateral O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
) O
can O
decrease O
cancer O
risk O
in O
carriers O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

These O
mutations O
continue O
to O
be O
a O
focus O
of O
intense O
investigation O
for O
development O
of O
better O
prevention O
strategies O
and O
treatment O
modalities O
. O

In O
studies O
reporting O
other O
high O
risk O
clinic O
databases O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
are O
uniformly O
more O
frequent O
than O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

The O
largest O
published O
analysis O
of O
genetic O
test O
results O
of O
commercially-tested O
patients B-species
found O
that O
among O
46,276 O
patients B-species
tested,5,795 O
harbored O
a O
deleterious O
BRCA B-gene
gene O
mutation O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
7.2 O
% O
carried O
a O
deleterious O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
and O
5.3 O
% O
of O
patients B-species
carried O
adeleterious O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

Thus O
42 O
% O
of O
mutations O
were O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
while O
58 O
% O
affected O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

We O
analyzed O
the O
Hispanic O
patients B-species
reported O
by O
Hall O
and O
found O
that O
36 O
% O
( O
from O
a O
total O
of O
290 O
patients B-species
) O
carried O
a O
deleterious O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

The O
University O
of O
Arizona O
Cancer O
Center O
( O
UACC O
) O
established O
a O
high O
risk O
clinic O
in O
2004 O
and O
it O
has O
grown O
steadily O
since O
. O

As O
of O
January O
2012 O
, O
251 O
patients B-species
were O
enrolled O
in O
a O
database O
to O
collect O
information O
about O
the O
clinical O
course O
of O
high O
risk O
patients B-species
. O

Unexpectedly O
, O
we O
observed O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
more O
common O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
in O
our O
clinic O
population O
. O

This O
is O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
a O
unique O
finding O
. O

We O
considered O
three O
hypotheses O
to O
explain O
this O
phenomenon O
: O
1 O
) O
a O
previously O
unrecognized O
mutation O
may O
be O
present O
in O
this O
population O
; O
2 O
) O
the O
unique O
ethnic O
composition O
of O
our O
community O
might O
have O
allowed O
maintenance O
of O
unique O
allele O
frequencies O
; O
or O
3 O
) O
by O
virtue O
of O
being O
a O
high O
risk O
clinic O
, O
we O
attract O
patients B-species
by O
marketing O
aimed O
at O
providers O
and/or O
the O
community O
and O
might O
have O
captured O
a O
unique O
population O
of O
patients B-species
who O
differ O
from O
those O
previously O
reported O
from O
high O
risk O
clinics O
. O

To O
address O
the O
first O
two O
hypotheses O
, O
we O
asked O
whether O
the O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
ratio O
is O
skewed O
in O
probands B-species
who O
self-identify O
as O
Hispanicor O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jewish I-species
. O

We O
also O
asked O
whether O
any O
specific O
mutations O
are O
over-represented O
in O
our O
probands B-species
. O

Some O
data O
suggest O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
develop O
cancer O
at O
an O
older O
age O
than O
their O
BRCA1 B-gene
counterparts O
. O

Thus O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
age O
at O
which O
probands B-species
presented O
to O
initiate O
preventative O
care O
, O
their O
prior O
cancer O
diagnoses O
and O
the O
burden O
of O
cancer O
in O
their O
pedigrees O
to O
address O
the O
third O
hypothesis O
. O

To O
explore O
this O
, O
we O
examined O
the O

the O
hypothesis O
that O

The O
higher O

low O
, O
the O
excess O
of O
newly O
identified O
or O

mutations O
in O

suggests O
that O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
are O
more O
likely O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
to O
be O
referred O
to O
the O
`` O
high O
risk O
'' O
clinic O
because O
they O
are O
identified O
as O
being O
high O
risk O
prior O
to O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
, O
based O
on O
a O
combination O
of O
later O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
and O
more O
complicated O
pedigrees O
. O

In O
order O
to O
test O
this O
hypothesis O
, O
we O
asked O
whether O
probands B-species
had O
a O
cancer O
diagnosis O
at O
time O
of O
presentation O
to O
care O
, O
and O
we O
compared O
the O
age O
of O
cancer O
diagnosis O
as O
well O
as O
the O
number O
of O
family O
members O
with O
cancer O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

There O
was O
no O
difference O
between O
the O
numbers O
of O
first O
, O
second O
, O
or O
total O
relatives O
with O
cancer O
between O
the O
two O
groups O
or O
in O
the O
age O
of O
cancer O
diagnosis O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
in O
our O
population O
. O

We O
did O
find O
, O
however O
, O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
probands B-species
were O
significantly O
more O
likely O
to O
present O
for O
cancer O
prevention O
efforts O
before O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
later O
age O
of O
cancer O
diagnosis O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
might O
provide O
a O
longer O
window O
of O
opportunity O
to O
establish O
a O
preventative O
care O
regimen O
; O
however O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
difference O
in O
age O
at O
subsequent O
cancer O
diagnosis O
remains O
confusing O
. O

Closer O
analysis O
suggests O
, O
also O
, O
that O
patients B-species
initially O
diagnosed O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
remain O
with O
their O
oncologist O
, O
instead O
of O
transferring O
to O
the O
high-risk O
cancer O
prevention O
clinic O
. O

Thus O
, O
earlier-diagnosed O
patients B-species
, O
who O
might O
be O
enriched O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
, O
may O
simply O
not O
be O
enrolling O
in O
our O
clinic O

If O
this O
is O
true O
, O
then O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
how O
at-risk O

are O
being O
identified O

of O

The O
factors O
leading O
to O
our O

which O
covalently O
link O

preventing O

Interstrand O

are O

they O

Repair O

a O
multistep O
processes O

beginning O
with O
endonucleolytic O
excision O
on O

followed O
by O
translesion O

As O

Platinum O
compounds O
( O

are O
effective O

Patients B-species

mutations O
have O
longer O
recurrence-free O
intervals O
than O
patients B-species
with O
sporadic O
ovarian B-disease
carcinomas I-disease
, O
especially O
when O

However O

occur O
in O
the O

of O

BRCA1/2-associated O
ovarian B-disease

the O
recurrent O
carcinomas O
eventually O
acquire O
platinum O

Studies O
have O
suggested O
several O
mechanisms O
that O
can O
lead O

cisplatin O
resistance O
including O
changes O
in O
transport O
of O
the O

BRCA1/2-deficient O
cells O
are O
highly O
sensitive O

PARP O
inhibitors O

many O
clinical O
trials O
of O
PARP O
inhibitors O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
patients B-species

BRCA1/2-mutated O
cancers O
are O
ongoing O
. O

PARP-1 O
attaches O
ADP-ribose O
to O
itself O
and O
other O
targets O
and O
facilitates O
repair O
of O
single O
strand O
breaks O
( O
SSBs O
) O
. O

PARP O
inhibition O
results O
in O
the O
accumulation O
and O
persistence O
of O
SSBs O
, O
which O
then O
can O
be O
converted O
into O
DSBs O
during O
S O
phase O
. O

HR O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
repair O
of O
DSBs O
in O
S O
phase O
. O

Therefore O
, O
inhibition O
of O
PARP O
in O
HR-deficient O
cells O
, O
such O
as O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
cells O
, O
results O

promising O
results O
of O
clinical O

BRCA-associated O

been O
reported O

However O
, O
not O
all O
of O
the O
patients B-species

BRCA1/2-mutated O

the O
PARP O

and O
even O
for O

Therefore O
, O
PARP O
inhibitor O
resistance O
is O
becoming O
a O
clinically O
important O
issue O

The O
mechanism O

clinical O
PARP O
inhibitor O

is O
not O
clear O
, O
but O
in O
BRCA1/2-mutated O
ovarian B-disease

treated O

a O
PARP O
inhibitor O
, O
there O
is O
an O
association O
between O
the O
clinical O
benefit O

, O
suggesting O
that O
there O
may O
be O
a O
common O
mechanism O

and O
PARP O

. O

Data O

A O
Lesson O
from O
a O
Rare O
Genetic O
Disease O
, O
Fanconi B-disease
Anemia I-disease
It O
is O
well O
known O
among O
researchers O
working O
on O
rare O
genetic O
diseases O
, O
such O
as O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
, O
that O
spontaneous O
genetic O
alterations O
that O
compensate O
for O
inherited O
disease-causing O
mutations O
( O
genetic O
reversion O
) O
sometimes O
occur O
. O

These O
genetic O
alterations O
in O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
include O
secondary O
genetic O
changes O
such O
as O
back-mutations O
to O
wildtype O
, O
compensatory O
mutations O
in O
cis O
, O
intragenic O
crossovers O
and O
gene O
conversion O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
is O
sometimes O
called O
`` O
natural O
gene O
therapy O
'' O
because O
patients B-species
with O
genetic O
reversion O
in O
their O
hematopoietic O
cells O
tend O
to O
have O
milder O
clinical O
phenotype O
. O

Cells O
derived O
from O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
patients B-species
are O
usually O
hypersensitive O
to O
interstrand O
crosslinking O
agents O
, O
but O
cells O
with O
genetic O
reversion O
are O
resistant O
. O

Furthermore O
, O

Similarly O

mitomycin O
C O

and O
in O

mitomycin O
C O
selection O
of O
V-C8 O
led O
to O
generation O
of O
mitomycin O
C-resistant O
clones O
that O
acquired O
an O
additional O
Brca2 B-gene
mutation O
leading O
to O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
open O
reading O

of O
one O
of O
the O
Brca2 B-gene

This O
knowledge O
led O
us O
to O
hypothesize O
that O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
that O
cancel O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
inherited O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O

mechanism O

Our O

that O
cisplatin/PARP O
inhibitor-resistant O
clones O
of O
BRCA2-mutated O
cancer O
cell O

can O
be O
generated O
in O

and O
that O
restoration O
of O
functional O
BRCA2 O
protein O
expression O
due O
to O
secondary O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
is O
a O
major O
mechanism O
for O
the O
observed O

In O

These O

that O

an O

mechanism O

cases O

We O
are O

secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

We O
also O
found O
a O

( O
back O

of O

This O

chemotherapy O

breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
many O
years O
before O
she O
developed O
ovarian B-disease

This O
anecdotal O

suggests O
an O
interesting O
possibility O
that O

may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
occurrence O
of O
secondary O

BRCA1/2 B-gene
in O
subsequent O

, O
but O
clearly O
we O
need O
a O
larger O
study O
to O
test O
this O
possibility O
. O

Several O
reports O

shown O
that O

though O

that O

in O

that O

Secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

possibly O
an O

To O

have O
not O

However O
, O
the O

preclude O
the O

Several O

Treatment O
with O
doxorubicin O

resulted O
in O
variable O

, O
although O
resistance O
always O
occurred O
to O
the O

Doxorubicin-resistant O
neoplasms O
upregulated O
the O
Mdr1a B-gene

that O

a O

, O
suggesting O
that O
efficient O

the O

out O

results O
in O
the O

. O

Brca1/2- O
and O
p53-deficient O
tumors O
also O
responded O
well O
to O
PARP O
inhibitor O
, O
although O
resistance O
always O
occurred O
due O
to O
upregulation O
of O
P-glycoprotein O

. O

Brca1-deleted O
neoplasms O
treated O
with O
cisplatin O
showed O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
size O
after O
treatment O
and O
eventually O
grew O
back O
. O

However O
, O
cisplatin-treated O
recurrent O
tumors O
were O
still O
sensitive O
to O
the O
drug O
. O

Moreover O
, O
PARP O
inhibitor-resistant O
Brca1-deleted O
tumors O
also O
had O
reduction O
in O
tumor O
volume O
after O
cisplatin O

consistent O
with O
the O
common O
notion O
that O
P-glycoprotein O
is O
not O
important O
for O
transport O
of O

. O

The O
fact O
that O
cisplatin-treated O
tumors O
recurred O
and O
were O
subsequently O
sensitive O
to O
another O
round O
of O
treatment O
with O
cisplatin O
suggests O
that O
there O
is O
a O
subset O
of O
the O
tumor O
population O
that O
evades O
killing O
by O
cisplatin O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
another O
report O
showed O
that O

with O
Brca1flox/flox/p53flox/flox O
( O
Brca1 B-gene

does O
occur O
. O

The O
difference O
of O
the O
two O
reports O
may O
be O
due O
to O
difference O
of O
Brca1 B-gene

( O

or O

Murine B-species
models O
of O
Brca1/2-deficiency O

do O
not O
mimic O
the O
most O

it O

Nevertheless O
, O

from O
the O

provide O

As O

Mechanism O
of O
Secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
Mutation O
The O
work O
reviewed O
here O
demonstrates O
that O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
an O
important O
mechanism O
of O
platinum O
resistance O
. O

How O
do O
these O
secondary O
mutations O
arise O
( O
Fig O
. O
2 O
) O
? O

We O
can O
easily O
imagine O
that O
at O
least O
3 O
factors O
can O
contribute O
to O
this O
phenomenon O
. O

First O
, O
treatment O
with O
DNA O
damaging O
agents O
such O
as O
cisplatin O
or O
carboplatin O
could O
increase O
the O
mutation O
rate O
. O

Second O
, O
BRCA1/2 O
deficiency O
could O
increase O
the O
mutation O
rate O
, O
since O
error-free O
HR O
DNA O
repair O
can O
not O
work O
efficiently O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
BRCA1/2 O
and O
cells O
rely O
on O
more O
error-prone O
mechanisms O
of O
DNA O
repair O
. O

Increased O
mutation O
rates O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
occurrence O
of O
secondary O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
themselves O
. O

Third O
, O
treatment O
with O
DNA O
damaging O
agents O
or O
with O
PARP O
inhibitors O
could O
serve O
as O
a O
selective O
pressure O
for O
BRCA1/2-restored O
cells O
. O

Secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
may O
be O
acquired O
during O
the O
course O
of O
chemotherapy O
. O

This O
can O
be O
a O
result O
of O
the O
increased O
amount O
of O
damaged O
DNA O
lesions O
caused O
by O
chemotherapy O
. O

Repair O
of O
these O
lesions O
would O
be O
error O
prone O
in O
the O
HR-defective O
, O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
cell O
background O
, O
which O
would O
increase O
the O
chance O
of O
occurrence O
of O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

In O
this O
model O
, O
the O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
neoplasm O
would O
shrink O
upon O
treatment O
with O
chemotherapy O
, O
leaving O
cells O
with O
acquired O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
secondary O
mutations O
to O
expand O
to O
form O
a O
drug O
resistant O
malignancy O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
resistance O
may O
result O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
subset O
of O
BRCA1/2-expressing O
cells O
that O
may O
exist O
in O
the O
tumor O
prior O
to O
chemotherapy O
. O

Tumors O
can O
be O
very O
genetically O
heterogeneous O
in O
nature O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
tumor O
comprises O
a O
small O
subset O
of O
cells O
that O
express O
functional O
BRCA1/2 O
protein O
due O
to O
a O
reversion O
event O
that O
occurred O
during O
the O
expansion O
of O
the O
tumor O
population O
. O

A O
precedent O
for O
this O
explanation O
exists O
. O

Lung B-disease
cancers I-disease
may O
express O
the O
EGFR B-gene
mutation O
T790M B-mutation
that O
confers O
resistance O
to O
EGFR O
tyrosine O
kinase O
inhibitors O
in O
rare O
cells O
prior O
to O
drug O
exposure O
if O
sensitive O
detection O
methods O
are O
used O
. O

Similarly O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
of O
chronic B-disease
myelogenous I-disease
leukemia I-disease
, O
BCR-ABL O
mutations O
that O
confer O
resistance O
to O
imatinib O
therapy O
are O
detectable O
by O
PCR O
in O
rare O
neoplastic O
cells O
prior O
to O
imatinib O
exposure O
. O

Treatment O
of O
such O
a O
neoplasm O
with O
a O
platinum O
agent O
, O
PARP O
inhibitor O
, O
or O
other O
drug O
that O
selectively O
kills O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
cells O
would O
result O
initially O
in O
a O
decrease O
of O
tumor O
size O
. O

The O
few O
BRCA1/2-expressing O
cells O
in O
the O
tumor O
population O
would O
survive O
the O
treatment O
. O

These O
cells O
can O
proliferate O
to O
form O
a O
BRCA1/2-proficient O
tumor O
, O
which O
would O
be O
resistant O
to O
further O
treatment O
with O
cisplatin O
or O
PARP O
inhibitor O
. O

In O
this O
model O
, O
drug O
treatment O
simply O
selects O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
population O
of O
BRCA1/2-expressing O
, O
drug-resistant O
cells O
. O

Further O
work O
is O
needed O
to O
distinguish O
between O
these O
two O
models O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
we O
do O
not O
know O
which O
error-prone O
DNA O
repair O
mechanisms O
are O
involved O
in O
generating O
secondary O
mutations O
, O
but O
microhomology-mediated O
end-joining O
and O
translesion O
synthesis O
are O
obvious O
candidates O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
point O
mutations O
or O
back O
mutations O
to O
wildtype O
( O
Tables O
1 O
and O
2 O
) O
. O

Error-prone O
translesion O
synthesis O
polymerases O
may O
be O
involved O
for O
the O
generation O
of O
these O
types O
of O
mutations O
. O

Microhomology-mediated O
end-joining O
may O
be O
a O
mechanism O
that O
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
occurrence O
of O
secondary O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
of O
BRCA2-deficient O
cells O
. O

Sequences O
surrounding O
the O
secondary O
BRCA2 B-gene
deletions O
in O
some O
of O
the O
drug-resistant O
Capan-1 O
clones O
and O
HCC1428 O
breast B-disease

have O
short O
regions O

sequence O
identity O
associated O
with O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
deleted O
region O
( O
Table O

) O
, O
suggesting O
involvement O
of O
microhomology-mediated O
end-joining O
. O

However O
, O
microhomology-mediated O
end-joining O
may O
not O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
secondary O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
of O
BRCA1-deficient O
cancer O
cells O
, O
since O
BRCA1 O
is O

facilitate O
microhomology-mediated O

53BP1 O

Chemotherapeutic O
response O
of O
tumors O
with O
BRCA1/2 O
deficiency O
may O
be O
affected O
by O
other O
genetic O
or O
epigenetic O
modifications O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
suppressor O
mutations O
of O
other O
genes O
in O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
cells O
may O
be O
able O
to O
reverse O
sensitivity O
of O
BRCA1/2-deficient O
cells O
to O
cisplatin O
and O
PARP O
inhibitors O
, O
without O
restoring O
BRCA1/2 O
themselves O
. O

Two O
recent O
reports O
have O
shown O
that O
loss O
of O
the O
DNA-damage O
response O
protein O
53bp1 O
in O
mice B-species
with O
Brca1-null O
or O
Brca1 B-gene
exon11 B-mutation
deletion I-mutation
mutation O
can O
rescue O
the O
embryonic O
lethality O
of O
Brca1-deficient O
mice B-species
. O

Brca1/53bp1-deficient O
cells O
have O
increased O
proliferative O
potential O
, O
chromosomal O
stability O
and O
HR O
efficiency O
relative O
to O
Brca1-deficient O
mouse B-species
cells O
. O

Importantly O
, O
53bp1 O
deficiency O
in O
Brca1-mutated O
cells O
also O
restored O
resistance O
to O
cisplatin O
and O
PARP O
inhibitor O
. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
that O
some O
estrogen B-disease
receptor-negative I-disease
, I-disease
progesterone I-disease
receptor-negative I-disease
and I-disease
HER2-non-overexpressing I-disease
( I-disease

) I-disease
and I-disease
BRCA1/2-associated I-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
have O
reduced O
53BP1 O
expression O
. O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
suppression O
of O
BRCA1 O
deficiency O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
53BP1 O
may O
be O
a O
modifier O
of O
clinical O
progression O
of O
BRCA-associated O
neoplasms O
. O

Further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
determine O
if O
53BP1 O
loss O
in O
BRCA1-deficient O
tumors O
can O
lead O
to O
clinical O
cisplatin/PARP O
inhibitor O
resistance O
. O

Clinical O
Implications O
The O
most O
profound O
implication O
of O
the O
work O
reviewed O
here O
on O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
BRCA1/2-associated O
malignancies O
is O
that O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutation O
may O
predict O
whether O
a O
patient B-species
will O
respond O
to O
platinum O
based O
chemotherapy O
. O

This O
may O
also O
be O
true O
for O
patients B-species
treated O
with O
PARP O
inhibitors O
, O
although O
there O
is O
the O
additional O
complication O
of O
upregulation O
of O
P-glycoprotein O
pumps O
contributing O
to O
resistance O
to O
this O
class O
of O
drugs O
. O

This O
work O
also O
suggests O
that O
restoration O
of O
DNA O
repair O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
acquired O
resistance O
to O
DNA O
damaging O
drugs O
. O

Therefore O
, O
drug-resistant O
cancers O
with O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
may O
be O
re-sensitized O
to O
those O
drugs O
if O
HR O
can O
be O
inhibited O
by O
another O
drug O
. O

For O
example O
, O
proteasome O
inhibitors O
, O
CDK O
inhibitors O
and O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
inhibit O
RAD51 O
foci O
formation O
. O

These O
drugs O
may O
be O
good O
candidates O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
platinum/PARP O
inhibitor-resistant O
malignancies O
in O
combination O
with O
cisplatin O
or O
PARP O
inhibitors O
. O

Future O
Directions O
Here O
we O
have O
reviewed O
evidence O
for O
the O
contribution O
of O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
to O
resistance O
to O
cisplatin O
and O
PARP O
inhibitors O
in O
BRCA1/2-mutated O
cancers O
. O

There O
still O
remain O
many O
unanswered O
important O
questions O
related O
to O
this O
mechanism O
. O

First O
, O
we O
need O
to O
perform O
larger O
clinical O
studies O
in O
order O
to O
correlate O
secondary O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
with O
clinical O
outcomes O
, O
such O
as O
resistance O
to O
platinum O
agents O
, O
PARP O
inhibitors O
and O
other O
chemotherapeutics O
. O

Second O
, O
we O
need O
to O
clarify O
which O
error-prone O
DNA O
repair O
mechanisms O
( O
for O
example O
, O
microhomology-mediated O
end-joining O
and O
translesion O
synthesis O
) O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
occurrence O

Introduction O
Hereditary B-disease

account O
for O
20 O
% O
of O

For O
the O
remaining O
80 O
% O

the O
genetic O
factors O

largely O
unknown O
and O
they O
are O
likely O
to O
involve O
mutations O

, O
plausibly O
acting O
together O
with O
some O
environmental O
or O
other O
hereditary O
factors O
. O

Apart O
from O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
BRCA1 B-gene

carriers O
might O
be O

, I-disease

, I-disease

. O

Pancreatic B-disease
cancers I-disease
are O
the O
fourth O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
cancer-related O
deaths O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
. O

Approximately O
5 O
% O
to O
10 O
% O
of O
individuals O
with O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
report O
a O
history O
of O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
a O
close O
family O
member O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
several O
known O
genetic O
syndromes O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
pancreatic B-disease

. O

Thus O
, O
germline O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
p16/CDKN2A O
, O
STK11 B-gene
, O
and O

that O

respectively O
, O
have O
been O
clearly O
associated O
with O
an O

Additionally O
, O
some O

The O
PALB2 B-gene
( O
partner B-gene
and I-gene
localizer I-gene
of I-gene
BRCA2 I-gene
) O
gene O
was O
identified O
by O
searching O
for O
novel O
components O
of O
endogenous O
BRCA2-containing O
complexes O
. O

PALB2 O
supports O
BRCA2 O
stability O
and O
determines O
its O
localization O
in O
the O
nucleus O
after O
DNA O
damage O
. O

Relocation O
of O
PALB2 O
and O
BRCA2 O
to O
damaged O
chromatin O
is O
regulated O
by O
BRCA1 O
. O

These O
three O
proteins O
form O
a O
complex O
in O
which O
PALB2 O
acts O
as O
a O
bridge O
between O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
. O

This O
complex O
is O
critical O
for O
the O
initiation O
of O
homologous O
recombination O
in O
the O
DNA-damage O
response O
. O

In O
cells O
depleted O
of O
PALB2 O
the O
DNA O
repair O
pathway O
dependent O
on O
the O
BRCA1/2 O
is O
disrupted O
. O

Immediately O
after O
PALB2 B-gene
was O
discovered O
, O
evidence O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
also O
a O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
gene O
, O
known O
as O
FANCN B-gene
. O

Biallelic O
inactivation O
mutations O
in O
PALB2/FANCN O
cause O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
subtype I-disease
N I-disease
, O
characterized O
by O
a O
severe O
predisposition O
to O
pediatric O
malignancies O
such O
as O
Wilms B-disease
tumor I-disease
, O
medulloblastoma B-disease
, O
AML B-disease
and O
neuroblastoma B-disease
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
gene O
underlying O
the O
D1 B-disease
subtype I-disease
of I-disease
Fanconi I-disease
anemia I-disease
, O
FANCD1 B-gene
, O
was O
found O
to O
be O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
biallelic O
mutations O
in O
BRCA2/FANCD1 O
originate O
a O
phenotype O
with O
high O
risk O
of O
childhood O
malignancies O
, O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
produced O
by O
PALB2/FANCN O
biallelic O
mutations O
. O

This O
supports O
the O
proposal O
that O
PALB2 O
is O
important O
for O
BRCA2 O
tumor O
suppression O
activity O
. O

As O
in O
other O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
genes O
, O
monoallelic O
mutations O
in O
PALB2 B-gene
have O
been O
associated O
with O
increased O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
. O

Thus O
, O
PALB2 B-gene
monoallelic O
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
approximately O
1 O
% O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
globally O
, O
as O
summarized O
by O
Tischkowitz O
and O
Xia O
. O

It O
has O
recently O
become O
clear O
that O
the O
PALB2 B-gene
gene O
should O
not O
only O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
susceptibility O
gene O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
but O
also O
for O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
pancreatic O
association O
was O
based O
on O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
PALB2 B-gene
mutation O
by O
exomic O
sequencing O
and O
the O
subsequent O
PALB2 B-gene
analysis O
in O
additional O
familial B-disease
pancreatic I-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
that O
revealed O
a O
prevalence O
of O
3.1 O
% O
. O

A O
similar O
prevalence O
( O
3.7 O
% O
) O
was O
found O
by O
Slater O

in O
European O
patients B-species
with O
familial B-disease

cancer I-disease
, O
whereby O
PALB2 B-gene

also O
had O
a O

of O
breast B-disease

. O

Given O
these O
findings O
, O
we O
aimed O

in O
a O

We O

for O
Spanish O
breast/ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
with O
at O

one O
male B-disease

Although O
we O
identified O
twice O
as O
many O

in O

with O

cases O
than O
in O
families O
with O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
, O
both O
prevalences O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
1 O
% O
reported O
for O

unselected O
for O

. O

Importantly O
, O
for O
most O
of O
the O
breast/pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
series O
analysed O
, O
index O

were O

Similarly O
, O
in O
our O
study O
only O
7 O
from O
the O
132 O
index O
cases O
were O
pancreatic B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
selection O
of O

cases O
could O
therefore O
be O
introducing O
a O
bias O
in O
the O
estimate O
of O
the O
prevalence O

PALB2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
these O

. O

The O
selection O
of O
a O
gene O
to O
be O
included O
in O
a O
routine O
genetic O
test O
would O
be O
, O
in O
part O
, O
based O
on O
the O

. O

However O
, O
the O
risk O
associated O
with O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
genes O
like O
PALB2 B-gene
is O
not O
easily O
determined O
since O

extremely O
rare O
in O
the O
population O

and O
the O
number O

in O

are O
small O
. O

Mutations O

originally O
associated O
with O
a O
moderate O
( O
2-3 O
fold O
) O
increase O
risk O
for O

. O

As O
higher O
risks O
were O
increasingly O
suggested O
, O
at O

for O

mutations O
, O
the O
inclusion O
of O
this O
gene O
in O
hereditary B-disease

cancer I-disease
tests O
would O
be O
justified O
. O

In O
our O

both O

from O

. O

It O
has O

that O
some O

a O
more O

including O

, O
higher O

Thus O
, O
tumors O

both O
the O

Since O

we O

out O

an O

Conclusions O
In O

we O

out O
a O

Discussion O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
nationwide O
study O
reporting O
a O
screen O
for O

in O
familial B-disease

patients B-species
in O

. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
3 O
LGRs O
were O
identified O
in O
3 O
out O
of O
143 O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
small O
mutation-negative O
patients B-species
. O

Each O
patient B-species
had O
an O
LGR O
unique O
to O
the O
family O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
LGRs O
were O
found O
only O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
. O

The O
most O
common O
mechanism O
of O
LGRs O
found O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
is O
known O
as O
the O
Alu-mediated O
unequal O
homologous O
recombination O
, O
followed O
by O
non-homologous O
events O
such O
as O
Alu/non-Alu O
or O
non-Alu/non-Alu O
, O
and O
a O
recombination O
event O
between O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
and O
a O
pseudogene O
. O

This O
mechanism O
occurs O
because O
of O
the O
high O
Alu O
density O
( O
41.5 O
% O
) O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
, O
which O
is O
4-fold O
higher O
than O
that O
in O
the O
human B-species
genome O
and O
2-fold O
that O
observed O
in O

and O
the O
other O
( O

because O
of O
non-homologous O
recombination O
events O
that O
are O

by O

. O

Non-homologous O

events O
frequently O

in O
deletions O

at O

This O

summarizes O
findings O
on O
these O
genes O
in O
Han B-species

. O

BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
2 O
most O
important O

. O

They O
have O
a O

the O
main O

INTRODUCTION O
Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
has O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
16.39 O
per O
100 O
000 O
Chinese O
women B-species
and O
seriously O
affects O
the O
lives O
and O
health O
of O
this O
population O
. O

Among O
women B-species
in O
economically O
developed O
Chinese O
provinces O
and O
cities O
, O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
has O
the O
highest O
incidence O
of O
all O
cancers O
and O
is O
the O
fourth O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
cancer O
death O
. O

Breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
also O
has O
a O
strong O
genetic O
background O
. O

Hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
tends O
to O
display O
familial O
aggregation O
and O
is O
associated O
with O
early O
age O
at O
onset O
and O
a O
high O
incidence O
of O
bilateral O
occurrence O
. O

Since O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
genes O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
1994 O
, O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
breast B-disease
cancer-associated O
susceptibility O
genes O
have O
been O
identified O
. O

These O
genes O
include O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
genes O
with O
high O
penetrance O
( O
CDH1 B-gene
, O
NBS1 B-gene
, O
NF1 B-gene
, O
PTEN B-gene
, O
TP53 B-gene
, O
and O
STK11 B-gene
) O
, O
moderate O
penetrance O
( O
ATM B-gene
, O
BRIP1 B-gene
, O
CHEK2 B-gene
, O
PALB2 B-gene
, O
and O
RAD50 B-gene
) O
, O
and O
low O
penetrance O
( O
FGFR2 B-gene
, O
LSP1 B-gene
, O
MAP3K1 B-gene
, O
TGFB1 B-gene
, O
and O
TOX3 B-gene
) O
. O

The O
United O
States O
and O
most O
countries O
in O
Europe O
have O
professional O
genetic O
services O
programs O
that O
provide O
genetic O
testing O
and O
counseling O
regarding O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Research O
on O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
Chinese O
population O
started O
late O
, O
and O
relevant O
studies O
of O
mainland O
Chinese B-species
have O
only O
begun O
to O
be O
reported O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
or O
so O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
these O
studies O
involved O
single O
centers O
and O
small O
numbers O
of O
cases O
, O
which O
are O
important O
shortcomings O
. O

China O
has O
56 O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
but O
the O
Han O
ethnic O
group O
makes O
up O
more O
than O
90 O
% O
of O
the O
country O
's O
population O
. O

Therefore O
, O
most O
studies O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
have O
focused O
on O
this O
population O
, O
to O
the O
exclusion O
of O
other O
ethnic O
groups O
. O

Moreover O
, O
although O
several O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
( O
SNPs O
) O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
low-penetrance O
susceptibility O
polymorphisms O
within O
genes O
, O
the O
frequencies O
of O
these O
polymorphisms O
substantially O
differ O
between O
races O
, O
which O
leads O
to O
inconsistent O
results O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
TGFRB1 B-gene
rs1982073 B-mutation
C-allele O
increases O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
many O
races O
but O
is O
not O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
the O
Chinese O
population O
. O

Eight O
SNPs O
( O
rs2046210 B-mutation
, O
rs1219648 B-mutation
, O
rs3817198 B-mutation
, O
rs8051542 B-mutation
, O
rs3803662 B-mutation
, O
rs889312 B-mutation
, O
rs10941679 B-mutation
, O
and O
rs13281615 B-mutation
) O
are O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
among O
Chinese O
women B-species
, O
and O
a O
risk O
assessment O
model O
that O
includes O
these O
genetic O
markers O
and O
clinical O
predictors O
might O
be O
useful O
in O
classifying O
Asian O
women B-species
into O
relevant O
risk O
groups O
. O

However O
, O
the O
moderate O
discriminatory O
accuracy O
provided O
by O
such O
a O
full O
risk O
assessment O
model O
was O
inadequate O
for O
cancer O
diagnosis O
and O
screening O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
absolute O
risk O
estimates O
generated O
by O
the O
model O
would O
be O
applicable O
only O
to O
populations O
with O
rates O
comparable O
to O
those O
seen O
in O
Shanghai O
. O

Therefore O
, O
further O
research O
is O
needed O
to O
evaluate O
low-penetrance O
susceptibility O
genes O
and O
their O
association O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
in O
the O
Chinese O
population O
. O

Currently O
, O
it O
is O
too O
early O
for O
low-penetrance O
susceptibility O
genes O
to O
be O
described O
as O
the O
target O
of O
genetic O
counseling O
in O
Chinese O
population O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
do O
not O
discuss O
such O
genes O
in O
this O
article O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
have O
chosen O
to O
review O

of O

and O
high-penetrance O

The O

Therefore O

the O

, O
The O
mutation O

In O
mutation O
screening O

, O
screening O

Models O

Most O

regard O

testing O
as O
standard O
for O
high-risk O
groups O
with O
early-onset O
or O
familial B-disease

such O
screening O
is O
sometimes O
recommended O
for O
women B-species
with O
a O
history O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

However O
, O
the O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
of O
these O
standards O
are O
a O
concern O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
China O
, O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
testing O
is O
unnecessary O
in O
more O
than O
80 O
% O
of O
so-called O
high-risk O
groups O
. O

Currently O
, O
there O
are O
some O
international O
models O

mutations O
, O
such O
as O
the O
BRCApro O
, O
BOADICEA O

of O
which O
BRCApro O
is O
the O
most O
commonly O

model O
for O

The O
BOADICEA O
model O
can O
be O
used O
for O
both O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
and O
age-specific O
breast I-disease

in O
small O

The O
Myriad O

developed O

The O

26 O

respectively O
. O

Clearly O
, O
these O
models O
are O
not O
suitable O
for O
the O
Chinese O
population O
, O
probably O
because O
the O
penetrance O
and O
prevalence O

of O
these O
models O
were O
derived O
from O

Chen O
et O

incorporated O
Asian-specific O

the O
BRCApro O

The O

, O
especially O
in O
the O
lowest O

, O
as O

with O
the O

. O

Therefore O
, O
Rao O
et O

established O
a O

model O
based O
on O
the O
characteristics O
of O
BRCA1- O

CONCLUSIONS O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
most O
important O
genetic O
factors O
in O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
Han O
Chinese O
population O
, O
but O
the O
mutation O
rates O
are O
lower O
than O
in O
other O
ethnic O
groups O
. O

Future O
efforts O
should O
emphasize O
development O
of O
a O
model O
that O
predicts O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutation O
, O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
unnecessary O
mutation-negative O
genetic O
testing O
. O

The O
characteristics O
of O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutations O
in O
the O
Chinese O
population O
suggest O
that O
screening O
may O
detect O
founder O
mutations O
. O

Subsequent O
founder O
mutation-negative O
cases O
could O
be O
detected O
in O
exon O
11 O
. O

If O
all O
the O
above O
results O
are O
negative O
, O
other O
exons O
should O
be O
tested O
. O

This O
process O
can O
improve O
detection O
efficiency O
and O
reduce O
the O
overall O
cost O
of O
testing O
. O

More O
research O
on O
non-coding O
regions O
is O
needed O
. O

Also O
, O
as O
in O
other O
populations O
, O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
warrant O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
mainland O
China O
. O

Although O
germline O
mutations O
in O
TP53 B-gene
and O
PALB2 B-gene
are O
rare O
, O
Chinese B-species
with O
BRCA1/BRCA2 O
mutation-negative O
high-risk O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
should O
be O
screened O
for O
these O
2 O
genes O
. O

Moreover O
, O
CHEK2 B-gene
H371Y B-mutation
should O
be O
considered O
in O
genetic O

. O

CHEK2 B-gene
1100delC B-mutation
, O
RAD50 B-gene
, O
and O
NBS1 B-gene
do O
not O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
Chinese O
population O
and O
should O
not O
be O
considered O
in O
genetic O
testing O
. O

There O
is O
a O
need O
for O
comprehensive O
studies O
of O
germline O

in O
other O
genes O
, O
such O
as O
CDH1 B-gene

such O
as O
Peutz-Jeghers B-disease
syndrome I-disease

, O
respectively O
, O
and O
need O
to O
be O
carefully O
investigated O
. O

The O
role O
of O

of O
these O
genes O
in O
breast B-disease

is O
not O
clear O

However O
, O
at O

, O
these O

have O
no O
value O
in O

. O

In O

Further O
studies O
are O
needed O
so O
as O
to O

The O
development O
of O
new O
technologies O
, O
such O
as O
next O

technology O
, O
has O
led O
to O
new O
ideas O
in O
the O

new O
susceptibility O

. O

The O
main O
purpose O
of O
research O
on O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
to O
identify O
high-risk O
individuals O
and O
develop O
early O
interventions O
, O
including O
intensive O
clinical O
examination O
and O
preventive O
measures O
that O
reduce O

morbidity O
and O
mortality O
. O

However O
, O
preventive O
intervention O

on O
individuals O
at O
high O
risk O
of O

are O
limited O
in O

. O

Thus O
, O
in O
China O
, O
and O
especially O
in O
mainland O
Chinese O
patients B-species
and O
clinicians O
, O
there O
is O
insufficient O
understanding O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
genetic O
screening O
and O

. O

Therefore O
, O
comprehensive O
genetic O

should O
be O
improved O
, O
to O
give O
them O
the O

support O
. O

Certain O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
are O
frequent O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
. O

Several O
factors O
contribute O
to O
this O
increased O
frequency O
, O
including O
consanguineous O
marriages O
and O
an O
event O
known O
as O
a O
`` O

'' O
, O
which O
occurred O
in O
the O
past O
and O
caused O
a O
drastic O
reduction O
in O
the O
genetic O
variability O
of O
this O
population O
. O

Several O
studies O
were O
performed O
over O
the O
years O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
elucidate O
the O
role O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
in O
susceptibility O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
estimate O
the O
carrier O
frequency O
of O
certain O
common O
mutations O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
( O
185delAG B-mutation

) O
and O

) O
genes O
in O
an O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
from O
Porto O
Alegre O
, O
Brazil O
. O

Molecular O
analyses O
were O
done O
by O
PCR O
followed O
by O
RFLP O
( O
ACRS O
) O
. O

The O
carrier O
frequencies O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
185delAG B-mutation
and O
5382insC B-mutation
were O
0.78 O
and O
0 O
respectively O
, O
and O
0.4 O
for O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
6174deT B-mutation
mutation O
. O

These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
some O
prior O
studies O
but O
differ O
from O
others O
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
excluding O
individuals O
with O
a O
personal O
or O
family O
history O
of O
cancer O
. O

Our O
sample O
was O
drawn O
from O
the O
community O
group O
and O
included O
individuals O
with O
or O
without O
a O
family O
or O
personal O
history O
of O
cancer O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
increased O
dispersion O
among O
Ashkenazi O
subpopulations O
may O
be O
the O
result O
of O
strong O
genetic O
drift O
and/or O
admixture O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
to O
consider O
the O
effects O
of O
local O
admixture O
on O
the O
mismatch O
distributions O
of O
various O
Jewish O
populations O
. O

Several O
factors O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
development O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
but O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
described O
so O
far O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
BReast B-gene
CAncer I-gene
predisposition I-gene
gene I-gene
1/2 I-gene
) O
gene O
mutations O
. O

Although O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
accounts O
for O
only O
5 O
% O
-10 O
% O
of O
recorded O
cases O
, O
individuals O
with O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
usually O
have O
40 O
% O
-80 O
% O
higher O
odds O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Even O
though O
several O
studies O
attempted O
to O
understand O
how O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
could O
influence O
cancer O
susceptibility O
, O
the O
variation O
in O
risk O
among O
carriers O
of O
these O
mutations O
is O
not O
yet O
clear O
. O

In O
certain O
groups O
, O
the O
frequency O
of O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
is O
higher O
, O
as O
observed O
in O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jews I-species
, O
where O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
are O
present O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
2 O
% O
-3 O
% O
. O

In O
this O
group O
, O
the O
three O
most O
frequently O
found O
mutations O
are O
: O
185delAG B-mutation
and O
5382insC B-mutation
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
6174delT B-mutation
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
and O
more O
than O
12 O
% O
of O
the O
women B-species
who O
develop O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
bear O
one O
of O
these O
mutations O
. O

Population O
studies O
corroborate O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
these O
common O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
which O
are O
frequent O
in O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jews I-species
, O
are O
involved O
in O
predisposition O
to O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease

We O

Our O

increased O

the O

has O
attracted O

from O
clinical O
laboratories O
. O

A O
workflow O
for O

was O
recently O
proposed O
and O
evaluated O
in O
. O

The O
analysis O
workflow O
was O
designed O
to O
detect O
both O
single O
nucleotide O
substitutions O
and O
microindels O
. O

It O
was O
based O
on O
TS2.0 O
variant O

followed O
by O
several O
filters O
, O
including O
a O
filter O
to O
consider O
only O

found O
at O
frequencies O
< O
15 O
% O
in O
the O
tested O

. O

The O
SNV O
calling O
using O
this O
workflow O
was O
impressive O
, O
with O

an O

when O

were O
not O
included O
in O
the O

For O
microindels O
, O
this O

had O
on O

one O

with O
an O

or O
87 O

. O

This O
is O
a O

The O
overall O

as O

callers O
, O
an O
estimate O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
the O
previous O
finding O
. O

Therefore O
we O
focused O
entirely O
on O
evaluating O
the O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
of O
indel O
detection O
due O
to O
the O
high O
FDR O
in O
the O
previous O
study O
. O

Our O
study O
further O
investigated O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
indel O
errors O
and O
then O
developed O
a O
simple O
workflow O
that O
combines O
either O
the O
TMAP-TS3.4 O
or O
BWA O
with O
the O
SAMtools O
variant O
caller O
. O

These O
workflows O
achieved O
higher O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
than O
the O
TS O
workflows O
or O
the O
workflow O
reported O
by O
Costa O
et O
al O
. O
in O
reference O
. O

For O
our O
combined O
training O
and O
test O
data O
, O
the O
FDR O
for O
TMAP-TS3.4 O
and O
SAMtools O
was O
2/7 O
( O
29 O
% O
) O
and O
4/9 O
( O
44 O
% O
) O
for O
BWA O
and O
SAMTools O
. O

Despite O
the O
improved O
FDRs O
of O
indel O
detection O
, O
the O
rates O
remain O
relatively O
high O
using O
the O
TMAP-TS3.4 O
and O
SAMtools O
as O
well O
as O
the O
BWA O
and O
SAMtools O
workflows O
for O
clinical O
genetic O
testing O
. O

With O
a O
large O
sample O
size O
, O
more O
systematic O
false O
positives O
will O
likely O
be O
found O
in O
multiple O
samples O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
is O
challenging O
to O
eliminate O
these O
false O
positives O
by O
defining O
a O
threshold O
based O
on O
mutation O
frequency O
of O
these O
samples O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
false O
positive O
indel O
filtered O
by O
QDth O
in O
one O
sample O
that O
marginally O
escaped O
filtering O
in O
another O
sample O
. O

We O
thus O
proposed O
to O
remove O
indels O
detected O
in O
a O
specific O
sample O
that O
were O
also O
found O
in O
the O
set O
of O
indels O
filtered O
by O
QDth O
and O
VARWth O
from O
other O
samples O
. O

Using O
this O
strategy O
, O
we O
managed O
to O
eliminate O
an O
additional O
false O
positive O
from O
each O
workflow O
without O
compromising O
sensitivity O
, O
achieving O
an O
FDR O
of O
1/6 O
( O
17 O
% O
) O
for O
TMAP-TS3.4 O
and O
SAMtools O
, O
and O
3/8 O
( O
38 O
% O
) O
for O
BWA O
and O
SAMTools O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
larger O
sample O
sizes O
and O
additional O
sample O
sets O
that O
have O
common O
true O
positive O
indels O
will O
be O
required O
in O
order O
to O
test O
the O
performance O
of O
this O
strategy O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O

An O

performed O
using O

The O
numbers O

The O
newer O
versions O

have O
shown O
improvements O
in O
both O
the O
alignment O
and O
variant O

performance O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
increased O
indel O

sensitivity O

specificity O
. O

However O
, O
even O
the O
very O
recent O
TS O
variant O

( O
TS3.4 O
) O
had O
a O
lower O
sensitivity O
than O
the O
GATK O
or O
SAMtools O
variant O
callers O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
present O
a O
computational O
workflow O
that O
( O

) O
uses O
the O
TS3.4 O
or O
BWA O
as O
the O
read O

( O

) O
SAMtools O

the O
variant O

and O
( O

) O
VARWth O
and O

as O
post-variant-calling O
filters O
. O

This O
workflow O
resulted O
in O

with O

Our O
findings O
demonstrate O
that O
a O

reduction O
of O
the O
false O

be O
achieved O

an O

Nevertheless O

the O

due O
to O
the O

this O

To O
determine O
the O
cause O

in O
the O
patient B-species

the O
K2729N B-mutation
allele O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
analyze O
cDNA O
from O
the O

However O
, O
as O

a O

Reversion O

However O
, O
early O

appeared O
sensitive O
in O

These O
cells O
, O
with O
minimal O

, O
were O
used O
for O
sequence O

We O
observed O
that O
both O

detected O
at O
equal O
levels O
, O
based O
on O
heterozygous O
SNPs O
in O
the O

We O
expected O
the O

( O

to O
be O
present O
at O

Indeed O
, O
inhibition O

the O

while O
the O

the O

remained O
relatively O
low O
( O

. O

These O
results O
suggested O
that O
the O

INTRODUCTION O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
two O
main O
genes O
predisposing O
individuals O
to O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Most O
monoallelic O
germline O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
are O
point O
variants O
or O
deletions/insertions O
of O
a O
few O
nucleotides O
. O

Large O
rearrangements O
( O
exon O
loss O
or O
duplication O
, O
5 O
' O
alterations O
, O
etc O
... O
) O
have O
also O
been O
described O
. O

These O
mutations O
are O
situated O
throughout O
the O
entire O
sequence O
of O
the O
two O
genes O
. O

In O
France O
, O
causal O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
account O
for O
about O
15 O
% O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
( O
HBOC B-disease
) O
. O

The O
pathogenic O
nature O
of O
variants O
resulting O
in O
a O
premature O
termination O
codon O
( O
PTC O
) O
has O
been O
clearly O
established O
for O
those O
variants O
leading O
to O
nonsense-mediated O
decay O
( O
NMD O
) O
, O
i.e O
. O

BRCA1 O
proteins O
with O
a O
PTC O
located O
upstream O
from O
the O
last O
10 O
carboxy-terminal O
codons O
, O
and O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
with O
a O
PTC O
located O
upstream O
from O
the O
last O
110 O
carboxy-terminal O
codons O
. O

Some O
specific O
missense O
variants O
can O
generate O
a O
PTC O
via O
abnormal O
splicing O
, O
while O
others O
clearly O
alter O
the O
function O
of O
BRCA1 O
, O
including O
all O
those O
occurring O
in O
the O
RING O
finger O
and O
some O
located O
in O
BRCT O
domains O
. O

The O
pathogenicity O
of O
these O
variants O
has O
been O
inferred O
from O
linkage O
analysis O
of O
high-risk O
families O
, O
functional O
assays O
, O
biochemical O
studies O
and/or O
demonstration O
of O
abnormal O
mRNA O
processing O
. O

The O
main O
difficulty O
encountered O
in O
molecular O
diagnosis O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
predisposition O
relates O
to O
the O
large O
number O
of O
variants O
with O
unclear O
clinical O
significance O
. O

Variants O
that O
do O
not O
create O
a O
PTC O
represent O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
DNA O
variants O
and O
are O
usually O
called O
unclassified O
variants O
( O
UVs O
) O
. O

UVs O
mostly O
consist O
of O
missense O
and O
intronic O
variants O
and O
in-frame O
deletions O
or O
insertions O
. O

Exhaustive O
collections O
of O
UVs O
could O
allow O
cosegregation O
studies O
within O
pedigrees O
, O
and O
these O
complementary O
data O
could O
help O
to O
define O
a O
reliable O
classification O
. O

Whether O
a O
given O
UV O
contributes O
to O
the O
disease O
phenotype O
or O
is O
merely O
a O
neutral O
variant O
( O
or O
a O
neutral O
polymorphism O
) O
has O
direct O
clinical O
implications O
. O

Several O
approaches O
can O
be O
used O
to O
determine O
pathogenicity O
, O
including O
multidisciplinary O
analysis O
of O
cosegregation O
within O
pedigrees O
and O

of O

of O

The O
material O
for O
the O
two O
major O
analyses O
was O
derived O
from O
two O
distinct O
clinical O

. O

The O
first O
analysis O
explored O

The O
term O
HGTIN B-disease
in O
this O
study O
connotes O
a O
high-grade B-disease
non-invasive I-disease
serous I-disease
tubal I-disease
intraepithelial I-disease

Histologic O
criteria O
for O
the O

been O
detailed O
previously O
, O
consisting O
of O
a O
combination O
of O

atypia O
and O
some O
loss O

polarity O
, O
typically O
accompanied O

Estimates O

from O

In O
2005 O
, O
the O
SEE-FIM O
protocol O
was O
instituted O
at O
Brigham O
and O
Women O
's O
Hospital O
and O
specified O
more O
thorough O
sectioning O
of O
the O
fimbriated O
end O
to O
increase O
the O
amount O
of O
surface O
area O
evaluated O
in O
the O
fimbriated O
end O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
100 O
% O
of O
every O
fimbria O
has O
been O
examined O
in O
this O
manner O
in O
BRCAm+ O
women B-species
, O
including O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
tube O
, O
excepting O
rare O
instances O
when O
a O
segment O
in O
the O
proximal O
one-third O
was O
retained O
for O
research O
. O

The O
overall O
frequency O
of O
early O
neoplasia O
in O
this O
population O
ranged O
from O
5.4 O
% O
( O
for O
any O
record O
of O
mutation O
) O
to O
5.8 O
% O
( O
deleterious O
mutations O
only O
) O
. O

This O
is O
similar O
to O
a O
prior O
study O
by O
Callahan O
et O
al O
from O
this O
institution O
that O
identified O
7 O
cancers O
in O
122 O
consecutive O
cases O
( O
5.7 O
% O
) O
. O

As O
shown O
in O
Figure O
2 O
, O
the O
frequency O
of O
cases O
in O
which O
neoplasia O
was O
detected O
increased O
significantly O
as O
a O
function O
of O
age O
. O

This O
indicates O
that O
the O
age O
of O
the O
cohort O
could O
influence O
the O
detection O
rate O
. O

A O
similar O
size O
study O
of O
women B-species
with O
a O
somewhat O
younger O
mean O
age O
( O
44 O
) O
reported O
occult O
cancers O
in O
8 O
of O
360 O
( O
2.2 O
% O
) O
, O
including O
6 O
HGTINs B-disease
. O

Another O
variable O
that O
might O
influence O
detection O
and O
age O
of O
presentation O
is O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
status O
. O

In O
this O
study O
both O
the O
population O
and O
neoplasms O
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
were O
younger O
than O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
positive O
group O
. O

These O
differences O
were O
not O
highly O
significant O
; O
however O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation-positive O
women B-species
with O
symptomatic O
high O
grade O
pelvic O
carcinoma O
are O
significantly O
younger O
than O
their O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation-positive O
counterparts O
( O
Meserve O
et O
al O
, O
unpublished O
) O
. O

Evidence O
thus O
suggests O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation-positive O
individuals O
may O
be O
more O
susceptible O
and O
at O
a O
younger O
age O
, O
in O
keeping O
the O
higher O
overall O
risk O
of O
malignancy O
and O
adverse O
outcome O
in O
this O
subset O
. O

BRCAm+ O
women B-species
who O
have O
undergone O
a O
RRSO O
with O
normal O
pathology O
have O
a O
reported O
4-5 O
per O
cent O
risk O
of O
a O
pelvic O
serous O
cancer O
on O
follow-up O
, O
an O
approximately O
4-9 O
fold O
greater O
risk O
than O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Going O
forward O
, O
this O
risk O
will O
likely O
be O
revised O
downward O
with O
the O
widespread O
adoption O
of O
protocols O
to O
thoroughly O
examine O
the O
distal O
fallopian O
tube O
. O

Such O
protocols O
should O
lower O
the O
miss O
rate O
for O
microscopic O
tubal O
neoplasia O
( O
HGTIN B-disease
) O
that O
could O
later O
recur O
, O
but O
may O
not O
address O
other O
potential O
sources O
of O
disease O
. O

Irrespective O
of O
site O
of O
origin O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
later O
recurrence O
when O
carcinoma O
is O
discovered O
is O
substantial O
. O

Powell O
et O
al O
noted O
a O
recurrence O
rate O
of O
47 O
% O
for O
cases O
with O
invasive O
carcinoma O
and O
in O
this O
study O
17 O
% O
( O
3 O
of O
18 O
) O
cases O
with O
invasion O
more O
advanced O
disease O
recurred O
. O

These O
individuals O
invariably O
are O
counseled O
to O
receive O
adjunctive O
therapy O
. O

The O
principal O
question O
is O
how O
to O
manage O
non-invasive O
neoplasia O
( O
HGTIN B-disease
) O
. O

One O
of O
17 O
( O
5.8 O
) O
% O
high-grade O
intraepithelial B-disease
neoplasms I-disease
in O
the O
study O
by O
Powell O
et O
al O
recurred O
at O
43 O
months O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
1 O
of O
11 O
( O
9 O
% O
) O
cases O
with O
HGTIN B-disease
alone O
recurred O
( O
Table O
2 O
) O
. O

If O
the O
data O
from O
these O
two O
studies O
are O
combined O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
recurrence O
following O
invasion O
or O
other O
evidence O
of O
spread O
( O
11 O
of O
32 O
) O
is O
significantly O
higher O
than O
that O
for O
intraepithelial B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
( O
2 O
of O
26 O
; O
p=.024 O
by O
Fishers O
exact O
test O
) O
. O

Wethington O
et O
al O
noted O
no O
recurrences O
in O
12 O
HGTINs B-disease
over O
a O
median O
of O
28 O
months O
. O

This O
supports O
aggressive O
management O
when O
the O
tumor O
has O
spread O
or O
advanced O
, O
but O
does O
not O
support O
prophylactic O
chemotherapy O
for O
HGTIN B-disease
alone O
, O
pending O
additional O
data O
that O
would O
clarify O
which O
patients B-species
with O
HGTIN B-disease
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
recurrence O
. O

The O
BRCAm+ O
population O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
efforts O
to O
devise O
models O
of O
frequency O
of O
HGTIN B-disease
and O
transit O
time O
from O
HGTIN B-disease
to O
serous O
cancer O
. O

They O
bear O
on O
both O
efforts O
to O
estimate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
prophylactic O
salpingectomy O
in O
preventing O
this O
disease O
and O
screening O
efforts O
to O
interrupt O
potentially O
curative O
stages O
of O
neoplasia O
. O

RRSO O
provides O
the O
unique O
opportunity O
to O
detect O
disease O
early O
and O
crudely O
estimate O
the O
timing O
of O
progression O
from O
early O
( O
such O
as O
HGTIN B-disease
) O
to O
advanced O
disease O
by O
either O
following O
women B-species
with O
HGTIN B-disease
or O
comparing O
the O
mean O
ages O
of O
patients B-species
at O
different O
stages O
of O
disease O
. O

Several O
confounders O
are O
unavoidable O
. O

The O
decisions O
of O
when O
to O
screen O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
and O
when O
to O
perform O
RRSO O
infuence O
the O
age O
at O
which O
an O
asymptomatic O
neoplasm O
will O
be O
detected O
. O

The O
timing O
of O
testing O
is O
patient B-species
dependent O
and O
often O
influenced O
by O
concerns O
raised O
with O
the O
prior O
detection O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Moreover O
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
positive O
cohorts O
with O
or O
without O
neoplasia O
tend O
to O
be O
slightly O
older O
than O
their O
BRCA1 B-gene
counterparts O
, O
further O
confounding O
the O
interpretation O
of O
age O
differences O
. O

Three O
findings O
in O
this O
study O
and O
others O
suggest O
that O
there O
might O
be O
a O
substantial O
interval O
from O
the O
onset O
of O
HGTIN B-disease
to O
either O
asymptomatic O
or O
symptomatic O
spread O
. O

First O
, O
most O
HGTINs B-disease
are O
not O
associated O
with O
recurrences O
, O
indicating O
the O
acquisition O
of O
metastatic O
potential O
takes O
time O
after O
a O
HGTIN B-disease
emerges O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
mean O
ages O
for O
patients B-species
with O
localized O
HGTIN B-disease
vs O
HGTIN B-disease
with O
advanced O
disease O
were O
49.2 O
and O
56.9 O
years O
, O
a O
difference O
that O
approached O
significance O
. O

Third O
, O
the O
lag O
time O
from O
discovery O
of O
a O
HGTIN B-disease
to O
( O
presumed O
) O
recurrence O
was O
43 O
and O
48 O
months O
in O
the O
two O
recurrences O
recorded O
this O
study O
and O
that O
of O
Powell O
et O
al O
. O

The O
first O
two O
observations O
imply O
that O
the O
tubal O
serous O
carcinogenic O
pathway O
conceivably O
might O
be O
interrupted O
by O
detecting O
pre-metastatic O
neoplasia O
, O
the O
removal O
of O
which O
would O
prevent O
subsequent O
disease O
. O

Although O
the O
above O
findings O
merit O
further O
studies O
to O
determine O
their O
relevance O
to O
serous O
cancer O
prevention O
, O
an O
equally O
compelling O
question O
remains O
to O
be O
answered O
, O
which O
is O
a O
paradox O
between O
the O
frequency O
of O
HGTIN B-disease
in O
RRSOs O
vs O
cases O
of O
symptomatic O
, O
advanced O
high-grade O
serous O
carcinoma O
. O

Estimates O
of O
associated O
HGTIN B-disease
in O
unselected O
women B-species
with O
symptomatic O
high O
grade O
cancer O
range O
from O
19 O
to O
59 O
percent O
, O
a O
distinct O
contrast O
to O
the O
rate O
of O
74 O
% O
in O
the O
asymptomatic O
population O
in O
this O
study O
. O

This O
implies O
that O
many O
cancers O
are O
not O
initiated O
in O
recognizable O
HGTINs B-disease
. O

Interestingly O
, O
Powell O
et O
al O
noted O
that O
the O
mean O
age O
of O
their O
cases O
with O
invasion O
was O
significantly O
younger O
than O
those O
with O
intraepithelial B-disease
neoplasia I-disease
only O
( O
50 O
vs. O
55 O
, O
p= O
0.04 O
) O
. O

Whether O
these O
discrepancies O
are O
a O
function O
of O
demographics O
, O
tissue O
sampling O
, O
different O
transit O
times O
, O
or O
variable O
pathways O
and O
organs O
( O
peritoneum O
, O
ovary O
etc O
) O
involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
pelvic O
serous O
cancer O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
. O

However O
, O
it O
leaves O
open O
the O
possibility O
that O
more O
than O
one O
carcinogenic O
pathway O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
development O
of O
high O
grade O
serous O
carcinoma O
, O
including O
one O
that O
manifests O
rapidly O
and O
not O
clearly O
of O
tubal O
origin O
. O

In O
a O
study O
of O
registry O
data O
of O
63 O
BRCAm+ O
cancers O
, O
Piek O
et O
al O
noted O
only O
6 O
% O
were O
reported O
as O
tubal O
in O
origin O
. O

This O
figure O
is O
a O
likely O
underestimation O
of O
tubal O
involvement O
, O
but O
nonetheless O
contrasts O
sharply O
with O
the O
detection O
rate O
in O
asymptomatic O
women B-species
. O

In O
a O
histologic O
analysis O
of O
tubes O
of O
symptomatic O
BRCAm+ O
women B-species
with O
carcinoma O
using O
the O
SEE-FIM O
protocol O
, O
we O
have O
found O
STIC B-disease
in O
less O
than O
40 O
% O
of O
cases O
( O
Meserve O
, O
Schulte O
and O
Crum O
, O
unpublished O
) O
. O

Thus O
, O
more O
thorough O
analysis O
of O
high-grade O
serous O
cancers O
in O
symptomatic O
BRCAm+ O
women B-species
is O
needed O
to O
shed O
light O
on O
this O
question O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
this O
study O
has O
shown O
a O
detection O
rate O
of O
5.4 O
% O
for O
early O
adnexal O
cancer O
in O
BRCAm+ O
women B-species
undergoing O
RRSO O
and O
a O
recurrence O
rates O
of O
from O
9-17 O
% O
over O
5 O
years O
depending O
on O
extent O
at O
the O
time O
of O
RRSO O
. O

There O
is O
a O
low-rate O
of O
recurrence O
overall O
following O
chemotherapy O
for O
local O
spread O
and O
an O
absence O
of O
cancer-related O
deaths O
in O
the O
first O
five O
years O
following O

. O

At O
this O
point O
there O
is O
no O
compelling O
justification O
for O
prophylactic O
chemotherapy O
in O
cases O
with O
TIC O
alone O
. O

The O
precise O
lag O

Despite O

important O
for O
the O

As O
our O

origin O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
p.Arg186 B-mutation

is O
a O

in O
the O
British O

however O

this O
hypothesis O

This O

. O

Although O
not O
statistically O
significant O
, O
these O
numbers O
support O
the O
findings O
of O
, O
indicating O
that O
two O
cases O

in O
a O

are O
required O
to O
provide O
a O
greater O
than O
1 O
% O
chance O

Moreover O
, O
in O
cases O
where O
the O
individual O
with O

not O
available O
for O
testing O
, O
it O
will O
be O
important O
to O
test O
the O
person B-species

Thus O
, O
RAD51D B-gene

the O

In O
consequence O
, O
a O

The O

Introduction O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
germline O
mutations O
are O
associated O
with O
an O
inherited O
predisposition O
to O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

Women B-species
with O
BRCA B-gene
germline O
mutations O
face O
significant O
reproductive O
pressure O
given O
the O
guidelines O
for O
prophylactic O
surgery O
in O
the O
form O
of O
risk-reducing O
bilateral O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
recent O
literature O
also O
suggests O
that O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
adversely O
affect O
ovarian O
function O
by O
decreasing O
ovarian O
reserve O
, O
which O
is O
defined O
as O
oocyte O
quantity O
, O
oocyte O
quality O
, O
and O
reproductive O
potential O
. O

Since O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
play O
critical O
roles O
in O
the O
repair O
of O
double-stranded O
DNA O
breaks O
, O
it O
is O
biologically O
plausible O
that O
germline O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
lead O
to O
accelerated O
oocyte O
apoptosis O
and O
depletion O
. O

In O
a O
small O
case-control O
study O
of O
women B-species

undergoing O
fertility O
preservation O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene

produced O
fewer O
oocytes O
than O

women B-species

Three O
epidemiological O
studies O
concluded O
an O
earlier O
age O

which O
supports O
the O
concept O
of O
a O

follicular O
pool O

However O

carriers O
have O
a O
decreased O

Discussion O
In O

of O

had O
a O
0.52 O
ng/mL O

adjusted O

AMH O
levels O
compared O

. O

BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
were O
noted O
to O
have O
a O
4-fold O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
AMH O
levels O
< O
1ng/mL O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
although O
the O
unadjusted O
AMH O
levels O
were O
comparable O
across O
all O
3 O
groups O
( O
Table O

) O
, O
the O
estimated O
mean O
AMH O
levels O
from O
the O
regression O
model O
( O
Table O

) O
demonstrated O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
age- O
and O
BMI- O
adjusted O
AMH O
levels O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
. O

This O
was O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
age O
is O
negatively O
correlated O
with O
AMH O
, O
and O
the O
controls O
were O
on O
average O
4 O
years O
older O
than O
the O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
. O

Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
have O
a O
lower O
ovarian O
reserve O
, O
and O
thus O
, O
contribute O
to O
the O
current O
body O
of O
literature O
on O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
and O
their O
reproductive O
outcomes O
. O

However O
, O
larger O
prospective O
studies O
with O
clinical O
outcomes O
such O
as O
infertility B-disease
and O
age O
at O
menopause O
are O
needed O
to O
further O
substantiate O
our O
findings O
. O

Because O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
play O
critical O
roles O
in O
the O
repair O
of O
double-stranded O
DNA O
breaks O
, O
germline O
mutations O
in O
these O
genes O
may O
lead O
to O
accelerated O
oocyte O
apoptosis O
and O
depletion O
. O

The O
mechanism O
of O
the O
decline O
in O
ovarian O
reserve O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
was O
elucidated O
in O
an O
important O
recent O
study O
by O
Titus O
et O
. O
al O
. O

In O
this O
landmark O
paper O
, O
the O
authors O
demonstrated O
using O
RNA O
interference O
in O
mouse B-species
oocytes O
that O
the O
inhibition O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
increased O
DNA O
double O
stranded O
breaks O
and O
reduced O
survival O
. O

Titus O
et O
. O
al O
. O
also O
determined O
that O
the O
primordial O
follicle O
pool O
was O
reduced O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
heterozygous O
mutant O
mice B-species
, O
but O
not O
in O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
heterozygous O
mutant O
mice B-species
, O
which O
supports O
our O
findings O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
findings O
, O
we O
were O
likely O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
serum O
AMH O
levels O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
carrier O
group O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
intriguing O
to O
consider O
the O
possibility O
that O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
have O
a O
differential O
effect O
on O
ovarian O
reserve O
, O
as O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
differs O
between O
the O
two O
mutations O
as O
well O
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
carry O
a O
higher O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
compared O
to O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
( O
40-65 O
% O
vs. O
20 O
% O
) O
, O
and O
BRCA1-associated O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
occur O
over O
a O
decade O
earlier O
than O
BRCA2-associated O
ovarian B-disease
cancers I-disease
. O

This O
difference O
in O
age O
penetrance O
is O
mirrored O
by O
in O
vitro O
studies O
where O
significant O
age-related O
decline O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
expression O
was O
observed O
in O
human B-species
oocytes O
from O
reproductive-age O
women B-species
; O
however O
, O
this O
was O
not O
noted O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
gene O
expression O
suggesting O
that O
the O
decline O
may O
occur O
in O
later O
years O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
have O
distinct O
molecular O
functions O
in O
the O
DNA O
repair O
pathway O
. O

As O
a O
multifunctional O
protein O
, O
BRCA1 O
interacts O
with O
other O
DNA O
repair O
proteins O
to O
detect O
damaged O
DNA O
, O
participates O
in O
homologous O
recombination-mediated O
repair O
of O
double-strand O
breaks O
, O
and O
activates O
checkpoints O
that O
delay O
the O
cell O
cycle O
to O
ensure O
that O
genetic O
errors O
are O
not O
transmitted O
to O
the O
next O
generation O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
BRCA2 O
plays O
a O
more O
limited O
role O
in O
homologous O
recombination O
repair O
by O
recruiting O
recombinase O
RAD51 O
to O
double O
strand O

. O

Taken O
together O
, O
this O
evidence O
supports O
a O
more O
critical O
role O
of O
BRCA1 O
in O
preventing O
oocyte O
depletion O
in O
reproductive-age O
women B-species
. O

Our O
results O
of O
lower O
AMH O
levels O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
may O
be O
suggestive O
of O
a O
shorter O
reproductive O
lifespan O
in O
these O
women B-species
, O
as O
AMH O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
predictive O
of O
age O
of O
menopause O
. O

This O
is O
a O
difficult O
question O
to O
investigate O
as O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
often O
opt O
to O
undergo O
risk-reducing O
bilateral O
salpingo-oophorectomies O
resulting O
in O
premature O
surgical O
menopause O
. O

Based O
on O

follow-up O
, O
45 O
BRCA1 B-gene

and O
17 O
BRCA2 B-gene

in O

the O

two O
relevant O
studies O

One O
study O
evaluated O

60 O
controls O
, O
and O
although O
this O
study O
reported O
similar O
results O
to O
ours O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
their O
BRCA1 B-gene

were O
affected O
by O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease

, O
which O
would O
represent O
a O

of O
a O
more O

. O

Our O
study O
included O

only O
, O

the O
possibility O
of O
such O

A O
more O

However O
, O
this O

did O
analyze O

, O
which O
may O
explain O
the O
difference O
in O
our O

. O

Our O
study O
has O
several O
important O
limitations O
. O

First O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
our O
findings O
are O
based O
on O
a O

The O
findings O
may O
not O
be O
generalizable O
to O
the O
larger O

. O

Second O
, O
although O
emerging O
data O
suggests O
that O
serum O
AMH O
levels O
may O
be O
affected O
by O
oral O
contraception O
use O
and O
cigarette O
smoking O
, O
our O
analyses O
did O
not O
account O
for O
these O
two O
factors O
in O
the O
regression O
model O
due O
to O
missing O
data O
. O

Further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
determine O
whether O
these O
two O
factors O
confound O
the O
association O
between O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
and O
AMH O
levels O
we O
observed O
. O

Third O
, O
the O
sample O
size O
of O
this O
study O
remains O
modest O
and O
limited O
particularly O
by O
the O
smaller O
sample O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
compared O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
, O
which O
likely O
contributes O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
significant O
finding O
in O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
group O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
preliminary O
results O
, O
a O
power O
analysis O
indicates O
that O
a O
future O
study O
would O
require O
approximately O
100 O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
and O
100 O
controls O
to O
determine O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
AMH O
levels O
, O
while O
covarying O
for O
age O
and O
BMI O
in O
a O
linear O
regression O
model O
. O

Lastly O
, O
as O
previously O
stated O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
longitudinal O
clinical O
data O
in O
this O
cohort O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
difference O
in O
serum O
AMH O
levels O
predicted O
reproductive O
outcomes O
such O
as O
fertility O
or O
age O
of O
menopause O
. O

This O
limits O
the O
ability O
to O
apply O
our O
findings O
to O
affect O
clinical O
care O
and O
counseling O
of O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
. O

Despite O
these O
drawbacks O
, O
we O
present O
the O
largest O
study O
thus O
far O
of O
unaffected O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
and O
our O
findings O
contribute O
to O
the O
limited O
literature O
that O
exists O
on O
the O
effect O
of O
BRCA B-gene
germline O
mutations O
and O
ovarian O
reserve O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
may O
have O
a O
decreased O
ovarian O
reserve O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
lower O
serum O
AMH O
levels O
, O
compared O
to O
women B-species
without O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

Our O
study O
broadens O
the O
scope O
of O
research O
on O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
beyond O
malignancies O
, O
a O
necessary O
step O
as O
surveillance O
and O

interventions O
have O
provided O
enhanced O

STATEMENT O
OF O
TRANSLATIONAL O
RELEVANCE O
Prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
a O
heterogenous O
disease O
with O
a O
variable O
natural O
history O
that O
is O
not O
accurately O
predicted O
by O
currently O
used O
prognostic O
tools O
. O

We O
report O
that O
BRCA-associated O
localized O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
represents O
an O
aggressive O
subset O
of O
the O
disease O
that O
may O
require O
active O
management O
with O
radiation O
therapy O
or O
surgery O
, O
and O
that O
expectant O
observation O
may O
not O
be O
appropriate O
. O

There O
has O
been O
little O
progress O
in O
the O
systemic O
management O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
beyond O
androgen O
deprivation O
therapy O
, O
and O
a O
novel O
therapeutic O
approach O
is O
urgently O
needed O
. O

Platinum-based O
therapies O
and O
more O
recently O
poly O
( O
ADP-Ribose O
) O

( O
PARP O
) O
inhibitors O
appear O
particularly O
active O
in O
BRCA-associated O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
and O
a O
clinical O
trial O
investigating O
these O
agents O
in O
BRCA-associated O

is O
warranted O
. O

INTRODUCTION O
Genome-wide O
association O
studies O
have O
identified O
common O
susceptibility O
loci O
in O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
independent O
chromosomal O
regions O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
but O
candidate O
genes O
at O
these O
loci O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
functionally O
implicated O
. O

While O
present O
in O
only O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
overall O
, O
mutations O
of O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
genes O
are O
commonly O
observed O
in O
families O
with O
multiple O
cases O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Whether O
detected O
in O
affected O
families O
or O
in O
the O
general O
population O
, O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
cause O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
women B-species
, O
and O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
prostate I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
men B-species
. O

Histologic O
differentiation O
is O
an O
established O
surrogate O
for O
survival O
in O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
and O
Gleason O
scoring O
is O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
grading O
system O
. O

Clinical O
management O
of O
this O
malignancy O
depends O
on O
assessment O
of O
clinical O
features O
, O
age O
of O
the O
patient B-species
, O
as O
well O
as O
histopathology O
of O
the O
tumor O
. O

There O
remains O
a O
critical O
need O
for O
prognostic O
markers O
to O
tailor O
therapeutic O
strategies O
, O
which O
may O
range O
from O
`` O
watch O
and O
wait O
'' O
to O
surgery O
or O
radiation O
therapy O
. O

BRCA B-gene
mutations O
may O
constitute O
one O
such O
prognostic O
marker O
, O
however O
, O
few O
studies O
have O
investigated O
the O
tumor O
characteristics O
of O
BRCA-associated O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

A O
more O
aggressive O
phenotype O
has O
been O
suggested O
by O
four O
analyses O
of O
BRCA-associated O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
but O
the O
largest O
study O
found O
no O
difference O
in O
histopathology O
between O
carriers O
and O
non-carriers O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
has O
been O
identified O
in O
prostate B-disease
tumors I-disease
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
, O
and O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
higher O
Gleason O
score O
. O

Prostate B-disease
cancer-specific O
mortality O
is O
a O
more O
robust O
endpoint O
and O
an O
association O
between O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
and O
earlier O
death O
due O
to O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
has O
been O
reported O
for O
patients B-species

. O

Here O
, O
we O
confirm O
a O
more O
aggressive O

associated O
with O
BRCA2-associated O
prostate B-disease

, O
and O

DISCUSSION O
Although O

It O
has O

Our O

, O
The O

However O
, O
the O

It O
is O
probable O
that O

that O

The O

is O
among O
the O

to O

but O
there O
is O
the O
general O
concern O
that O
combining O
incident O
and O

could O
have O
introduced O
a O
survival O
bias O
in O

Recent O
studies O
of O

have O
noted O
that O

not O
result O
in O
a O

a O
survival O
bias O
due O

would O
tend O
to O
obscure O
adverse O

a O

in O
the O

Another O
limitation O
of O
this O
study O
is O
the O
use O

a O
non-concurrent O

the O

opportunity O

. O

However O
, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
subclinical O
prostate B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
a O
younger O
control O
group O
would O
have O
resulted O
in O
a O

and O
would O
not O
have O

If O
it O
is O

that O

a O
more O

course O
for O
men B-species

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
small O
number O

the O

The O
additional O

that O
the O

shorter O
in O

and O

These O
findings O
demonstrate O
that O
heterozygosity O
for O
a O
mutant O
tumor O
suppressor O
gene O
can O
alter O
the O
expression O
profiles O
of O
phenotypically O
normal O
epithelial O
cells O
in O
a O
gene-specific O
manner O
; O
these O
detectable O
effects O
of O
`` O

'' O
represent O
early O
molecular O
changes O
in O
tumorigenesis O
that O
may O
serve O
as O
novel O
biomarkers O
of O
cancer O
risk O
and O
as O
targets O
for O

. O

Introduction O
The O
notion O
of O
multistep O
carcinogenesis O
posits O
that O
rate-limiting O
mutations O
accumulate O
in O
a O
single O
cell O
and O
its O
progeny O
, O
marking O
recognizable O
histopathological O
transitions O
in O
the O
target O
tissues O
. O

The O
time O
required O
for O
this O
accumulation O
affords O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
whether O
pharmacological O
and/or O
dietary O
interventions O
can O
delay O
or O
prevent O
the O
transition O
to O
malignancy O
. O

Early O
targeted O
intervention O
would O
be O
optimally O
performed O
on O
persons B-species
with O
a O
very O
high O
risk O
of O
developing O
a O
specific O
cancer O
, O
as O
with O
those O
individuals O
who O
carry O
a O
germline O
mutation O
in O
a O
gene O
known O
to O
impose O
such O
a O
risk O
. O

Rationale O
for O
such O
an O
intervention O
is O
provided O
by O
early O
studies O
that O
demonstrated O
that O
cells O
heterozygous O
for O
a O
cancer-predisposing O
mutation O
could O
show O
abnormalities O
in O
tissue O
cultures O
; O
`` O
one-hit O
'' O
effects O
in O
heterozygous O
cells O
were O
seen O
in O
morphologically O
normal O
cultured O
fibroblasts O
and O
in O
epithelial O
cells O
derived O
from O
Familial B-disease
Adenomatous I-disease
Polyposis I-disease
( O
FAP B-disease
) O
patients B-species
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
have O
recently O
reported O
specific O
changes O
in O
protein O
expression O
in O
colonic O
epithelial O
cells O
from O
FAP B-disease
patients B-species
. O

Support O
for O
the O
significance O
of O
these O
early O
changes O
comes O
from O
observations O
of O
similar O
aberrations O
in O
corresponding O
cancer O
cells O
, O
. O

Such O
changes O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
progression O
to O
malignancy O
and O
therefore O
constitute O
targets O
for O
strategies O
to O
delay O
or O
prevent O
such O
progression O
in O
FAP B-disease
and O
in O
other O
genetic O
predispositions O
to O
cancer O
. O

With O
this O
rationale O
in O
mind O
we O
have O
undertaken O
an O
investigation O
of O
two O
of O
the O
most O
common O
predisposing O
genes O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
( O
, O
and O
references O
therein O
) O
in O
two O
important O
target O
tissues O
, O
breast O
and O
ovary O
. O

We O
note O
that O
previous O
reports O
on O
benign O
cells O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
already O
suggest O
the O
possibility O
of O
such O
heterozygous O
effects O
. O

We O
have O
compared O
the O
transcriptomes O
of O
primary O
breast O
and O
ovarian O
epithelial O
cultures O
from O
patients B-species
predisposed O
to O
cancer O
, O
bearing O
monoallelic O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
, O
with O
corresponding O
cultures O
from O
control O
individuals O
. O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
morphologically O
normal O
epithelial O
cells O
from O
mutation O
carriers O
exhibit O
abnormalities O
in O
a O
gene-specific O
and O
tissue-specific O
manner O
, O
consistent O
with O
detectable O
single-hit O
effects O
. O

These O
alterations O
constitute O
possible O
molecular O
targets O
for O
intervention O
on O
the O
path O
to O
cancer O

Although O
these O
specific O
molecular O
changes O
are O
yet O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
cancer O
initiation O
and O
progression O
, O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
both O
BRCA O
proteins O
have O
clear O
functional O
links O
to O
transcription O
. O

Indeed O
, O
both O
are O
mediators O
of O
the O
cellular O
response O
to O
DNA O
damage O
that O
includes O
a O
transcriptional O
component O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
damage O
does O
occur O
in O
normal O
cells O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
physiological O
DNA O
replication O
processes O
, O
although O
it O
is O
repaired O
with O
high O
efficiency O
, O
and O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
part O
of O
a O
protein O
complex O
with O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
and O
the O
CBP O
and O
p300 O
histone O
acetyltransferases O
that O
is O
involved O
in O
chromatin O
remodeling O
and O
transcription O
. O

Because O
of O
these O
links O
to O
transcription O
, O
alterations O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
proteins O
in O
single-hit O
cells O
might O
be O
expected O
to O
lead O
to O
multiple O
gene O
expression O
differences O
. O

Intriguingly O
, O
some O
of O
the O
gene O
expression O
profiles O
enriched O
in O
breast O
BRCA1 B-gene
one-hit O
cells O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
detected O
in O
stem O
and O
progenitor O
cells O
( O
Fig O
. O
5A O
) O
. O

This O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
true O
for O
one-hit O
BRCA2 B-gene
breast O
epithelial O
cells O
. O

Indeed O
, O
recent O
findings O
from O
the O
Wicha O
laboratory O
indicate O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
gene O
is O
involved O
in O
regulating O
stemness O
and O
differentiation O
of O
breast O
progenitor O
cells O
. O

Also O
, O
more O
recently O
, O
human B-species
mammary O
epithelial O
cells O
from O
BRCA1-mutation O
carriers O
were O
found O
to O
form O
progenitor O
cell O
colonies O
on O
semisolid O
medium O
with O
higher O
plating O
efficiency O
as O
compared O
to O
mammary O
epithelial O
cells O
from O
reduction O
mammoplasty O
controls O
. O

In O
general O
, O
we O
found O
more O
expression O
changes O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
vs. O
WT O
cells O
than O
with O
BRCA2 B-gene
vs. O
WT O
cells O
( O
Table O
2 O
) O
, O
which O
may O
reflect O
the O
fact O
that O
BRCA2 O
is O
primarily O
involved O
in O
double-strand O
break O
repair O
, O
whereas O
BRCA1 O
may O
also O
bridge O
double-strand O
break O
repair O
and O
signal O
transduction O
pathways O
. O

Thus O
, O
BRCA1 O
may O
act O
both O
as O
a O
sensor O
of O
DNA O
damage O
and O
as O
a O
repair O
factor O
, O
whereas O
BRCA2 O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
involved O
primarily O
in O
actual O
repair O
. O

Even O
small O
alterations O
in O
levels O
of O
the O
sensor O
( O
BRCA1 O
) O
may O
have O
phenotypic O
consequences O
in O
terms O
of O
differentially O
expressed O
genes O
. O

This O
is O
reminiscent O
of O
animal O
models O
with O
hypomorphic O
alleles O
of O
the O
mismatch O
repair O
protein O
MSH2 O
( O
part O
of O
the O
damage O
sensor O
) O
that O
are O
proficient O
for O
mismatch O
repair O
per O
se O
but O
defective O
for O
activation O
of O
the O
cellular O
DNA O
damage O
response O
. O

An O
additional O
important O
finding O
from O
this O
study O
is O
that O
some O
of O
the O
molecular O
changes O
detected O
correspond O
to O
candidate O
biomarkers O
described O
previously O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
such O
as O
mammaglobin O
and O
serum O
amyloid O
protein O
for O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
respectively O
( O
Tables O
2 O
and O
3 O
) O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
GSEA O
analysis O
reveals O
that O
the O
dataset O
of O
breast O
epithelial O
BRCA1 B-gene
one-hit O
cells O
shows O
similarities O
to O
that O
of O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
associated O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
( O
Fig O
. O
5B O
) O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
findings O
from O
this O
study O
are O
largely O
consistent O
with O
what O
is O
known O
about O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
sporadic O
cancers O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
genes O
with O
abnormal O
patterns O
of O
expression O
that O
seem O
unrelated O
. O

Both O
their O
number O
and O
their O
unrelatedness O
are O
unexplainable O
based O
on O
what O
is O
known O
about O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
cancers O
, O
but O
they O
may O
be O
early O
changes O
associated O
indirectly O
with O
cancer O
initiation O
. O

For O
example O
, O
heterozygosity O
may O
trigger O
a O
phenomenon O
such O
as O
induction O
of O
expression O
of O
siRNAs O
, O
each O
of O
which O
might O
affect O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
genes O
In O
principle O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
genetic O
approach O
used O
in O
this O
study O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
model O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
biomarkers O
for O
epithelial O
malignancies O
in O
general O
, O
and O
for O
the O
use O
of O
such O
markers O
as O
targets O
for O
chemoprevention O
measures O
that O
would O
decrease O
the O
probability O
of O
a O
second O
`` O

or O
greatly O
reduce O
its O
occurrence O

In O

Homozygosity O
for O
this O
mutation O
was O
plausible O
particularly O
because O
it O

a O
founder O
mutation O
in O
the O
studied O

Nevertheless O
, O
this O
report O
has O
long O
been O
questioned O
because O
potential O
primer O
bias O

PCR-based O
genotyping O
could O
have O
led O
to O
preferential O
amplification O

the O
putative O

hence O
masking O

heterozygosity O

Because O
of O
the O
importance O

this O

report O
for O
the O

our O

we O
re-sequenced O

that O
only O

From O

we O

Our O

are O

with O

of O
the O

afforded O

Boyd O

showed O
that O
eighty-one O
Jewish O
patients B-species

ovarian B-disease

had O
a O
significantly O
longer O
disease-free O
interval O
after O

chemotherapy O
( O

, O
and O
improved O
overall O

( O
p O

compared O
to O
those O
patients B-species

. O

Ben O
David O
et O

. O
demonstrated O
that O
234 O
Israeli O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
carrying O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
BRCA B-gene

had O
an O
improved O
survival O
of O
3 O
years O
( O
p O
< O

) O
over O
non-carriers O
. O

Our O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
, O
compared O
to O
matched O
, O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
, O
non-AJ O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
had O
longer O
PFS O
( O
p O
< O
0.001 O
) O
and O
OS O
( O
p O
< O
0.001 O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
BRCA B-gene
status O
was O
an O
independent O
predictor O
of O
both O
progression-free O
and O
overall O
survival O
. O

A O
recent O
retrospective-cohort O
study O
by O
Tan O
et O
al. O
, O
reported O
similar O
finding O
regarding O
differences O
in O
overall O
survival O
( O
p O
< O
0.002 O
) O
and O
time O
to O
first O
relapse O
( O
p O
< O
0.001 O
) O
, O
using O
matching O
criteria O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
the O
current O
study O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Tan O
study O
included O
only O
22 O
BRCA-positive O
patients B-species
, O
which O
included O
patients B-species
with O
both O
BRCA B-gene
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
and O
non-Jewish O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

Our O
study O
included O
a O
large O
number O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
with O
non-Jewish O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
and O
was O
consistent O
in O
finding O
a O
survival O
advantage O
for O
women B-species
with O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
this O
report O
clarifies O
previous O
earlier O
reports O
of O
conflicting O
data O
regarding O
BRCA-positive O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
not O
of O
Jewish O
heritage O
. O

The O
control O
group O
from O
GOG O
182 O
provides O
a O
second O
, O
large O
group O
of O
advanced-stage O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
for O
comparison O
and O
validates O
the O
results O
obtained O
with O
our O
sporadic-matched O
patients B-species
. O

The O
survival O
advantage O
afforded O
to O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
is O
evident O
, O
even O
though O
the O
GOG O
control O
group O
may O
include O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
inclusion O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
would O
tend O
to O
shift O
the O
results O
toward O
the O
null O
hypothesis O
of O
no O
difference O
in O
survival O
. O

The O
GOG O
control O
group O
is O
similar O
to O
our O
control O
group O
, O
in O
that O
it O
includes O
only O
advanced-stage O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
. O

Also O
, O
both O
control O
groups O
include O
a O
variety O
of O
patients B-species
that O
may O
have O
had O
optimal O
or O
suboptimal O
tumor O
reduction/cytoreductive O
surgery O
, O
as O
well O
as O
possible O
interval O
cytoreductive O
surgery O
. O

It O
is O
noted O
that O
overall O
survival O
is O
shorter O
in O
the O
GOG O
control O
group O
than O
our O
sporadic-matched O
group O
( O
42.9 O
months O
vs. O
54.3 O
months O
) O
. O

The O
difference O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
younger O
age O
of O
the O
matched-sporadic O
cohort O
( O
as O
a O
result O
of O
matching O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
because O
the O
sporadic O
patients B-species
had O
to O
survive O
for O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
time O
in O
order O
to O
be O
matched O
for O
the O
`` O
interval O
to O
testing O
, O
'' O
their O
survival O
times O
may O
be O
longer O
than O
that O
of O
a O
random O
group O
of O
advanced-stage O
epithelial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
. O

Our O
study O
failed O
to O
demonstrate O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
odds O
of O
complete O
response O
to O
initial O
chemotherapy O
between O
the O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
and O
their O
sporadic O
counterparts O
. O

This O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
data O
on O
response O
to O
initial O
chemotherapy O
was O
unknown O
in O
10.8 O
% O
of O
patients B-species
. O

There O
is O
an O
inherent O
dilemma O
in O
performing O
a O
study O
based O
on O
a O
genetic O
test O
, O
when O
that O
particular O
test O
is O
not O
`` O
standard O
of O
care O
'' O
for O
all O
patients B-species
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
dilemma O
is O
easily O
overcome O
in O
the O
Jewish O
population O
because O
a O
majority O
of O
Jewish O
mutation O
carriers O
carry O
one O
of O
only O
three O
founder O
mutations O
. O

Genetic O
testing O
is O
not O
only O
warranted O
, O
but O
is O
less O
expensive O
, O
in O
that O
specific O
population O
. O

When O
not O
all O
patients B-species
in O
both O
cohorts O
are O
tested O
, O
there O
is O
concern O
for O
possible O
`` O
survival O
bias O
, O
'' O
a O
criticism O
of O
the O
Rubin O
study O
and O
others O
. O

Our O
goal O
was O
to O
overcome O
these O
confounding O
factors O
in O
study O
design O
in O
order O
to O
address O
the O
question O
of O
a O
possible O
survival O
advantage O
afforded O
by O
non-AJ O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

In O
order O
to O
be O
included O
in O
this O
matched O
group O
, O
a O
sporadic O
patient B-species
had O
to O
have O
survived O
at O
least O
as O
long O
as O
the O
corresponding O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
lived O
to O
undergo O
genetic O
testing O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
date O
of O
genetic O
testing O
was O
the O
starting O
point O
for O
any O
difference O
in O
survival O
. O

Matching O
for O
`` O
interval O
to O
testing O
'' O
may O
have O
actually O
underestimated O
the O
survival O
advantage O
, O
because O
sporadic O
patients B-species
who O
died O
early O
of O
their O
disease O
would O
have O
been O
excluded O
from O
the O
sporadic-matched O
group O
and O
would O
not O
have O
been O
included O
in O
the O
analysis O
. O

This O
specific O
bias O
would O
potentially O
affect O
the O
results O
by O
shifting O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
sporadic O
group O
toward O
the O
null O
, O
lessening O
the O
reported O
difference O
in O
both O
progression-free O
and O
overall O
survival O
in O
the O
matched O
comparison O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
difference O
in O
survival O
, O
between O
the O
non-AJ O
BRCA B-gene
patients B-species
and O
the O
sporadic O
patients B-species
, O
may O
have O
been O
underestimated O
in O
our O
study O
. O

As O
defined O
, O
even O
patients B-species
in O
the O
sporadic O
group O
have O
up O
to O
a O
35 O
% O
risk O
of O
carrying O
a O
deleterious O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
, O
with O
a O
negative O
personal O
and O
family O
history O
, O
leading O
to O
possible O
misclassification O
of O
BRCA-associated O
cancers O
within O
the O
sporadic O
group O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
age-matching O
within O
in O
the O
sporadic O
group O
led O
to O
a O
younger O
median O
age O
of O
diagnosis O
then O
the O
`` O
typical O
'' O
sporadic O
patients B-species
. O

Although O
these O
patients B-species
have O
no O
other O
risk O
factors O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
, O
young O
age O
alone O
may O
increase O
risk O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
undetected O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
sporadic O
group O
may O
have O
lead O
to O
a O
bias O
toward O
the O
null O
hypothesis O
, O
underestimating O
the O
survival O
difference O
attributable O
to O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

This O
study O
gives O
insight O
into O
the O
natural O

of O
ovarian B-disease

This O
is O

We O
extensively O

We O
observed O
three O

We O
detected O
low O

represent O
less O

Alternative O

is O
less O
common O
for O

A O

However O
, O
recent O

indicate O
that O

its O

We O
detected O

This O
constitutive O

suggests O
that O
the O
delta3-transcript O

not O

in O
tumorigenesis O
in O

The O
physiological O
role O

this O

In O

Our O

Consequently O
, O
the O

be O
considered O

be O
neutral O
in O
terms O

The O
relevance O

remains O
to O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
these O
cases O
, O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
wild-type O
allele O
in O

would O
lead O
to O
an O
allele O
which O
produces O
two O
forms O
of O
protein O

domain O
. O

Thus O
, O
we O
suggest O
these O
three O
distinct O

should O
remain O
unclassified O

until O
co-segregation O

which O
would O
clarify O
whether O
there O
is O
any O

. O

The O
results O
we O
obtained O
for O
the O
three O

that O
we O
studied O

that O
we O
confirmed O
by O
the O

, O
have O
not O

previously O
. O

No O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
delta3/wild O

ratio O
was O
detected O
. O

This O
contrasts O
with O
the O
Portuguese O
Alu O
insertion O
mutation O
, O
which O
creates O
a O
stop O
codon O
10 O
nucleotides O
after O
the O
insertion O
, O
but O
exclusively O
expresses O
the O
delta3-transcript O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
mutated O
mRNAs O
, O
that O
contain O
the O
premature O
stop O
codon O
, O
are O
not O
eliminated O
or O
destabilized O
by O
NMD O
. O

Indeed O
, O
if O
NMD O
were O
involved O
, O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
full-length O
transcript O
from O
the O
mutant O
allele O
would O
have O
been O
significantly O
decreased O
, O
whereas O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
the O
delta3-trancript O
issued O
from O
both O

would O
probably O
not O
be O
modified O
, O
thus O
leading O
to O
a O
global O
increase O
of O
the O
proportion O
of O
the O
delta3-transcript O
. O

An O
additional O
argument O
towards O
a O

would O
reside O
in O
the O
impact O
of O
the O

at O
the O

, O

PALB2 O

an O

component O

It O

our O

the O

Conclusion O
There O
are O
strong O
arguments O
to O
suggest O
that O

be O
a O
cause O

The O

the O

DNA O

response O
functions O

. O

Furthermore O
exclusive O
expression O
of O
the O
delta3-transcript O
co-segregates O
with O
the O
disease O
. O

Our O
study O
suggests O
that O
exclusive O
transcript O
expression O
from O
the O
mutated O
allele O
contributes O
to O
high O
risk O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
whereas O
moderate O

low O

are O
neutral O
as O
long O
as O
the O
full-length O

is O
present O
at O
a O
roughly O
normal O

. O

However O
, O
the O
question O
remains O
open O
whether O
low O
to O
moderate O
levels O
of O
the O
delta3-transcript O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
BRCA2 O
functions O

could O
contribute O

, O
particularly O
for O
those O

that O

. O

Noteworthy O
, O
although O
the O

the O

Discussion O
Secondary O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
SN B-disease
among O
women B-species
who O
have O
received O
high O
dose O
radiotherapy O
. O

However O
, O
secondary O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
a O
rare O
disease O
in O
men B-species
and O
very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
its O
aetiology O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
carcinogenic O
effect O
of O
ionizing O
radiation O
may O
be O
similar O
in O
the O
male O
and O
prepubertal O
female O
breast O
. O

Beside O
the O
radiation O
exposure O
, O
some O
of O
the O
risk O
factors O
for O
primary O
MBC B-disease
were O
also O
found O
in O
our O
patient B-species
with O
secondary O
MBC B-disease
- O
i.e O
. O
hormonal O
imbalances O
and O
gynecomasty O
. O

Genetic O
factors O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
primary O
MBC B-disease
include O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
that O
account O
for O
4 O
% O
to O
14 O
% O
of O
all O
primary O
MBC B-disease
. O

We O
found O
no O
such O
mutations O
; O
only O
a O
rare O
V1269V B-mutation
polymorphism O
that O
does O
not O
affect O
protein O
function O
. O

Since O
p53 B-gene
is O
often O
mutated O
in O
female B-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
, O
it O
could O
be O
mutated O
also O
in O
MBC B-disease
. O

Even O
though O
the O
mutations O
in O
tumour O
suppressor O
gene O
p53 B-gene
are O
correlated O
with O
numerous O
malignancies O
, O
no O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
our O
patient B-species
while O
screening O
this O
gene O
. O

Also O
in O
MMR O
genes O
( O
MLH1 B-gene
and O
MSH2 B-gene
) O
and O
in O
CDKN2A B-gene
no O
deleterious O
mutations O
have O
been O
detected O
( O

We O
found O
polymorphisms O
in O
MMR O
genes O
- O
MLH1 B-gene
and O
MSH2 B-gene
, O
frequently O
detected O
in O
a O
general O

, O
but O
also O
three O
variants O
( O
two O

one O

) O
which O
are O
described O
as O
variants O
with O

on O
the O

. O

This O
finding O
could O
be O
of O
interest O
since O
recent O
reports O
allude O
that O
two O
of O
these O
variants O
in O
MSH2 B-gene
( O
c.2006-6T B-mutation
> I-mutation
C I-mutation
and O
p.G322D B-mutation
) O
might O
influence O
the O
process O
of O
cancer O
development O
. O

Nucleotide O
variant O
c.2006-6T B-mutation
> I-mutation
C I-mutation
may O
be O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
of O
Non-Hodgkin O
's I-disease
Lymphomas I-disease
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
some O
haematological O
malignancies O
in O
individuals O
carrying O
c.2006-6T B-mutation
> I-mutation
C I-mutation
variant O
is O
increased O
after O
the O
treatment O
with O
alkylating O
agents O
such O
as O
procarbazine O
, O
dacarbazine O
, O
cyclophospahmide O
. O

According O
to O
some O
recent O
reports O
the O
variant O
p.G322D B-mutation
is O
associated O
with O
changes O
in O
MSH2 O
protein O
function O
. O

Individuals O
with O
this O
variant O
have O
slightly O
reduced O
release O
efficiency O
of O
mismatched O
targeted O
DNA O
compared O
to O
the O
wild O
type O
. O

Conclusions O
To O
our O
knowledge O
there O
are O
no O
reports O
of O
genetic O
screening O
in O
secondary O
MBC B-disease
. O

We O
found O
three O
unclassified O
variants O
that O
could O
be O
correlated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
secondary O
MBC B-disease
but O
further O
studies O
should O
be O
performed O

The O

concluded O
that O

should O
continue O

Since O

over O
5000 O
different O

in O
these O

have O
been O
identified O
that O
are O

and O
are O
responsible O
for O
approximately O
5 O
% O

One O
of O
the O
major O

factors O
for O
HBOC B-disease
is O
the O
development O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
a O
very O
young O
age O
, O
Thus O
, O
the O
National O
Comprehensive O
Cancer O
Network O
( O
NCCN O
) O
guidelines O
panel O
has O
recommend O
initiating O
screening O
at O
ages O
20 O
to O
25 O
years O
, O
or O
5 O
to O
10 O
years O
earlier O
than O
the O
youngest O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
in O
the O
family O
. O

Implementing O
screening O
techniques O
is O
meant O
to O
identify O
cancers O
at O
the O
earliest O
time O
possible O
; O
therefore O
, O
estimating O
the O
onset O
of O
disease O
is O
vital O
in O
timing O
the O
initiation O
of O
screening O
and O
interventions O
. O

Anticipation O
has O
been O
described O
as O
a O
phenomenon O
observed O
in O
inherited O
diseases O
such O
as O
Fragile B-disease
X I-disease
syndrome I-disease
and O
Huntington B-disease
disease I-disease
, O
in O
which O
the O
disease O
occurs O
at O
younger O
ages O
or O
with O
increased O
severity O
of O
disease O
in O
subsequent O
generations O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
this O
anticipation O
has O
been O
identified O
as O
DNA O
instability O
, O
such O
as O
nucleotide O
repeats O
that O
change O
in O
length O
in O
subsequent O
generations O
, O
altering O
the O

of O
the O
disease O
. O

However O
, O
changes O
in O
disease O
phenotype O
in O
subsequent O
generations O
also O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
other O
disorders O
, O
such O
as O
in O
colon B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
Alzheimer B-disease
disease I-disease
, O
and O
diabetes B-disease
. O

With O
the O
increase O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
testing O
, O
there O
also O
has O
been O
an O
increase O
in O
families O
being O
evaluated O
and O
screened O
for O
HBOC B-disease
. O

There O
have O
been O
several O
reports O
of O
anticipation O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

To O
date O
, O
these O
reports O
have O
been O
based O
on O
very O
small O
cohorts O
; O
those O
studies O
indicated O
an O
earlier O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
and O
examined O
the O
absolute O
differences O
between O
matched O
pairs O
. O

Dagan O
and O
Gershoni-Baruch O
reported O
a O
statistically O
significant O
difference O
of O
approximately O
4 O
years O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
and O
a O
statistically O
nonsignificant O
numerical O
difference O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Peixoto O
et O
al O
and O
Paltiel O
et O
al O
also O
observed O
similar O
patterns O
of O
earlier O
age O
of O
diagnosis O
for O
subsequent O
generations O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
registries O
. O

When O
discussing O
appropriate O
screening O
interventions O
for O
women B-species
with O
a O
known O
deleterious O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
, O
potential O
interventions O
include O
clinical O
breast O

, O
magnetic O

, O
and O

. O

Evaluating O
for O
patterns O
of O
inheritance O
like O
anticipation O
in O
families O
with O
known O
deleterious O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
may O
help O
promote O

provide O
further O
insight O
into O
the O
timing O

screening O
initiation O
and O

interventions O
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
current O

was O
to O
evaluate O
any O

in O
age O
at O
diagnoses O
in O
families O

add O
to O
the O

A O
secondary O

completed O
using O
the O
method O
proposed O
by O
Larsen O

based O
on O
a O

model O
for O

, O
which O
studies O
the O

family O
instead O
of O
parent-child O
pairs O
. O

The O
advantage O
of O
this O
model O
is O
that O
all O
of O
the O
individuals O
who O
are O
known O
to O
be O
at O

in O
a O
family O
can O
be O
contained O
in O
the O

We O
applied O
the O
basic O
model O
( O

Thus O
, O

denotes O
the O

Also O
, O
Tij O
denotes O
the O
age O
at O

, O
mui O
is O
the O
estimator O

of O
the O

, O
gamma O

, O
and O
epsilonij O
is O
the O

It O
is O

that O
the O

DISCUSSION O
In O
the O
current O
analysis O
, O
we O
evaluated O
families O
with O
HBOC-related O
cancers O
in O
at O
least O
2 O
generations O
and O
described O
trends O
in O
differences O
in O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
between O
these O
generations O
. O

We O
observed O
an O
earlier O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
in O
younger O
generations O
whether O
we O
used O
the O
t O
test O
for O
paired O
data O
or O
the O
more O
inclusive O
parametric O
model O
for O
analyzing O
anticipation O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
when O
we O
examined O
differences O
in O
subsets O
( O
BRCA1 B-gene
families O
vs O
BRCA2 B-gene
families O
, O
inheritance O
through O
the O
mother O
's O
or O
the O
father O
's O
side O
, O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
families O
were O
affected O
by O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
only O
or O
by O
both O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
) O
, O
these O
age O
differences O
remained O
. O

The O
magnitude O
of O
the O
age O
differences O
between O
these O
subsets O
varied O
and O
, O
although O
they O
may O
have O
been O
affected O
by O
the O
small O
subset O
numbers O
, O
they O
add O
to O
the O
growing O
evidence O
of O
genetic O
anticipation O
in O
HBOC B-disease
. O

With O
the O
onset O
of O
genetic O
testing O
for O
HBOC B-disease
and O
other O
cancer O
genetic O
syndromes O
, O
providing O
guidance O
for O
the O
timing O
of O
screening O
and O
prophylactic O
interventions O
will O
be O
critical O
to O
preventing O
cancers O
in O
future O
generations O
. O

Currently O
, O
guidelines O
, O
like O
those O
published O
by O
the O
NCCN O
, O
suggest O
that O
screening O
should O
be O
initiated O
for O
HBOC-related O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
age O
25 O
years O
, O
or O
5 O
to O
10 O
years O
earlier O
than O
the O
age O
at O
earliest O
diagnosis O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
this O
recommendation O
appears O
to O
be O
sufficient O
and O
appropriate O
. O

However O
, O
if O
true O
genetic O
anticipation O
is O
observed O
with O
this O
syndrome O
, O
then O
monitoring O
for O
these O
shifts O
in O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
in O
future O
generations O
will O
be O
required O
to O
better O
prepare O
caregivers O
and O
patients B-species
with O
regard O
to O
the O

. O

There O
are O
several O
limitations O
to O
this O
analysis O
. O

We O
have O
identified O
families O
with O
a O
known O
deleterious O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
, O
but O
testing O
was O
not O
available O
for O
many O
affected O
family O
members O
from O
previous O
generations O
. O

The O
mutations O
that O
were O
identified O
in O
this O
cohort O
are O
listed O
in O
Table O
3 O
. O

Assumptions O
had O
to O
be O
made O
regarding O
genetic O
carrier O
status O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
pedigrees O
were O
drawn O
from O
information O
provided O
by O
the O
proband B-species
, O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
may O
have O
been O
affected O
by O
recall O
bias O
. O

Additional O
information O
regarding O
previous O
bilateral O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
may O
have O
influenced O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
and O
could O
not O
be O
included O
it O
in O
our O
data O
set O
. O

This O
factor O
should O
be O
documented O
and O
tracked O
in O
prospective O
series O
. O

Genetic O
counseling O
sessions O
at O
our O
institution O
are O
preceded O
by O
a O
family O
history O
questionnaire O
that O
is O
mailed O
to O
the O
proband B-species
in O
advance O
of O
their O
visit O
. O

They O
are O
encouraged O
to O
discuss O
with O
family O
members O
regarding O
diagnosis O
, O
cancer O
type O
, O
and O
age O
at O
onset O
. O

When O
possible O
, O
probands B-species
are O
encouraged O
to O
provide O
pathology O
reports O
of O
family O
members O
to O
evaluate O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
the O
type O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
; O
however O
, O
it O
was O
very O
uncommon O
for O
patients B-species
to O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
this O
documentation O
. O

Another O
potential O
bias O
is O
referral O
bias O
. O

Because O
our O
institution O
is O
a O
tertiary O
cancer O
center O
, O
our O
patient B-species
base O
is O
younger O
on O
average O
than O
the O
general O
population O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

There O
may O
be O
multiple O
other O
factors O
that O
influence O
the O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
, O
such O
as O
race O
, O
exposures O
, O
and O
other O
environmental O
factors O
, O
that O
were O
not O
available O
as O
part O
of O
our O
analysis O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
improvements O
in O
imaging O
techniques O
, O
such O
as O
digital O
mammography O
and O
dedicated O
breast O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
, O
may O
help O
diagnose O
HBOC-related O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
earlier O
in O
more O
recent O
generations O
. O

These O
and O
other O
factors O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
future O
prospective O
cohort O
analyses O
. O

For O
potential O
statistical O
bias O
, O
family O
members O
may O
not O
have O
had O
complete O
information O
regarding O
unaffected O
individuals O
in O
their O
pedigree O
. O

This O
may O
have O
affected O
the O
statistical O
analysis O
as O
part O
of O
the O
parametric O
model O
for O
analyzing O
anticipation O
. O

This O
also O
may O
bias O
the O
result O
toward O
younger O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
in O
younger O
generations O
. O

In O
light O
of O
this O
factor O
, O
the O
true O
difference O
between O
2 O
generations O
may O
be O
< O
7.9 O
years O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
highly O
significant O
result O
is O
still O
a O
strong O
proof O
of O
the O
tendency O
for O
the O
younger O
generation O
to O
develop O
HBOC-related O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
younger O
ages O
than O
their O
affected O
older O
generation O
. O

In O
the O
future O
, O
as O

and O

more O
entrenched O
in O
the O

DISCUSSION O
We O
did O
not O
find O
significant O
differences O
with O
respect O
to O
fertility O
among O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
and O
noncarriers O
after O
adjusting O
for O
confounders O
. O

Cases O
in O
our O
study O
had O
significantly O
fewer O
pregnancies O
compared O
to O
controls O
, O
even O
after O
adjusting O
for O
confounders O
of O
fertility O
, O
but O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
this O
reflects O
the O
known O
protective O
effect O
of O
parity O
against O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Despite O
lower O
pregnancy O
rates O
, O
pregnancy O
success O
was O
similar O
for O
mutation O
carrier O
and O
noncarrier O
cases O
and O
controls O
. O

Theoretically O
, O
conferring O
beneficial O
effect O
on O
fertility O
and/or O
pregnancy O
success O
could O
lead O
to O
positive O
selection O
for O
a O
mutation O
. O

In O

evidence O
suggests O
a O
role O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
in O
embryogenesis O
and O
fertility O
; O
however O
, O
molecular O
mechanisms O
of O
this O
putative O
effect O
remain O
to O
be O
elucidated O
. O

Although O
we O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
for O
an O
effect O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
on O
female O
fertility O
or O
prenatal O
survival O
, O
factors O
pertaining O
to O
the O
study O

may O
have O
affected O
our O
results O

such O

it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
obtain O
medical O

such O
information O

all O

. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
sample O
may O
have O
also O
influenced O
our O
results O
. O

We O
found O
an O
excess O
of O
females O
among O
the O
offspring O
of O
female O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
in O
two O
generations O
. O

Our O
results O
are O
in O
agreement O
with O
earlier O
findings O
of O
a O
large O
excess O
of O
females O
in O
BRCA B-gene
positive O
families O
. O
reported O
sex O
ratio O
distortions O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
families O
only O
; O
we O
found O
an O
excess O
of O
females O
among O
the O
offspring O
of O
female O
carriers O
of O
both O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
although O
the O
ratios O
were O
more O
skewed O
among O
the O
offspring O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
. O

While O
subsequent O
studies O
attributed O
the O
observed O
sex O
ratio O
distortions O
in O
BRCA B-gene
families O
to O
possible O
confounding O
by O
ascertainment O
and/or O
selection O
biases O
, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
either O
of O
these O
sources O
of O
bias O
would O
have O
influenced O
our O
results O
. O

Details O
of O

have O
been O

Ascertainment O
bias O
is O
unlikely O
since O
all O
prevalent O
cases O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
identified O
through O
the O

were O
invited O
to O

. O

To O
further O
reduce O
ascertainment O
bias O
, O
all O
probands B-species
were O
removed O
as O
offspring O
in O
sex O

. O

The O
possibility O
of O
selection O

influencing O
our O
results O
is O
equally O
remote O
. O

Overall O
participation O

for O
our O

reasons O
for O

included O
severe O
illness O
, O
concerns O
about O

implications O
, O
and O
inability O
to O
speak O
English O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
any O
potential O
selection O
bias O
would O
have O
applied O
to O
both O
carrier O
and O
noncarrier O
cases O
. O

Survival O
bias O
may O
exist O
in O
our O
study O
but O
that O
would O
also O
apply O
to O
both O
carrier O
and O
noncarrier O
cases O
and O
is O
unlikely O
to O
explain O
or O
influence O
the O
sex O
ratio O
distortions O
observed O
. O

A O
preponderance O
of O
females O
among O
the O
offspring O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
our O
study O
, O
could O
contribute O
to O
positive O
selection O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
through O
several O
mechanisms O
. O

Greater O
fertility O
and/or O
pregnancy O
success O
, O
as O
discussed O
above O
, O
may O
provide O
a O
selective O
advantage O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
. O

If O
this O
effect O
occurs O
only O
in O
females O
, O
then O
higher O
number O
of O
females O
who O
are O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
would O
magnify O
the O
selective O
advantage O
even O
further O
. O

Another O
mechanism O
through O
which O
female O
preponderance O
among O
the O
offspring O
of O
mutation O
carriers O
could O
contribute O
to O
positive O
selection O
for O
those O
mutations O
is O
related O
to O
the O
proposed O
historical O
excess O
of O
breeding O
females O
over O
males O
and O
the O
proposed O
evolutionary O
advantage O
of O
females O
for O
becoming O
population O
founders O
during O
sex-biased O
genetic O
bottleneck O
events O
. O

The O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
gone O
through O
at O
least O
one O
genetic O
bottleneck O
event O
in O
its O
two O
millennia O
history O
and O
there O
is O
a O
debate O
in O
the O
literature O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
contribution O
of O
recent O
versus O
ancient O
founder O
effects O
to O
the O
high O
frequency O
of O
several O
disease O
alleles O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Recently O
, O
a O
mitochondrial O
DNA O
analysis O
provided O
evidence O
for O
a O
strong O
effect O
of O
genetic O
drift O
on O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
gene O
pool O
marked O
by O
an O
early O
bottleneck O
event O
which O
is O
estimated O
to O
have O
occurred O
about O
1,500 O
years O
ago O
. O

Although O
no O
historical O
evidence O
has O
been O
presented O
to O
indicate O
that O
this O
bottleneck O
event O
was O
sex-biased O
, O
evolutionary O
genetic O
studies O
suggest O
a O
higher O
female O
effective O
population O
size O
, O
greater O
migration O
, O
and O
dispersion O
of O
females O
in O
earlier O
societies O
, O
and O
evolutionary O
advantage O
of O
females O
over O
males O
for O
becoming O
population O
founders O
. O

Thus O
an O
increased O
number O
of O
female O
population O
founders O
with O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
combined O
with O
strong O
genetic O
drift O
patterns O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
a O
higher O
frequency O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
. O

Although O
this O
scenario O
, O
which O
is O
dependent O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
on O
genetic O
drift O
, O
is O
a O
possibility O
, O
a O
more O
plausible O
explanation O
for O
the O
high O
frequency O
of O
two O
different O
mutations O
, O
namely O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
185delAG B-mutation

originally O

as O
a O

, O
but O
no O

has O
been O

. O

NBR1 O
has O

described O
as O
a O
highly O

multidomain O
scaffold O
protein O
involved O
in O
targeting O

No O

have O
been O
ascribed O
to O
either O
the O
PsiBRCA1 B-gene
or O
the O
NBR2 B-gene
genes O
, O
which O
seem O
to O
result O
from O
a O

event O
. O

Regarding O
RND2 O
, O
which O
is O
a O
RHO O
family O
small O

, O
this O
is O
involved O
in O
regulating O
the O

Finally O
, O

a O

Inadvertently O
, O
we O
also O
detected O
an O
amplification O
of O
the O
region O
corresponding O
to O
the O
ZFPM2 B-gene
locus O
( O
8q23 O

which O
did O
not O
affect O
any O

Defects O
in O
this O

may O
be O
a O
cause O
of O

( O

a O

( O

However O
, O
our O

did O
not O
show O
any O
clinical O
evidence O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

BRCA B-gene
genes O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
repair O
of O

( O
DSBs O
) O
by O
homologous O

maintaining O
the O

division O
. O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
functional O
BRCA1 O
or O
BRCA2 O
DSBs O
are O
repaired O
by O
an O
error-prone O
non-homologous O
end-joining O
mechanism O
that O
provokes O
mutations O
and O
genomic O
instability O
. O

The O
case O
herein O
reported O
is O
deficient O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
we O
may O
speculate O
that O
it O
would O
be O
prone O
to O
accumulate O
genetic O
instabilities O
that O
in O
this O
case O
affect O
the O
ZFPM2 B-gene
region O
. O

The O
great O
peculiarity O
of O
the O
case O
herein O
reported O
is O
that O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
deletion O
is O
not O
present O
in O
any O
other O
family O
member O
, O
including O
both O
parents O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
would O
constitute O
the O
first O
case O
of O
a O
patient B-species
with O
a O
de O
novo O
whole-gene O
BRCA1 B-gene
deletion O
. O

Since O
the O
incorporation O
of O
LGR O
analysis O
into O
the O
standard O
practice O
of O
genetic O
counselling O
laboratories O
the O
number O
of O
LGRs O
reported O
have O
almost O
tripled O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
sextupled O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
just O
in O
the O
last O
4 O
years O
, O
including O
at O
least O
81 O
different O
LGRs O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
. O

Most O
of O
the O
characterized O
LGRs O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
have O
been O
described O
throughout O
the O
gene O
as O
intragenic O
deletions O
or O
duplications O
resulting O
from O
unequal O
recombination O
events O
between O

the O
majority O
are O

, O
and O
generally O
introduce O
a O
premature O
termination O
codon O
in O
the O
reading O
frame O
. O

This O
fact O
is O
justified O
by O
the O
genetic O
structure O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
with O
numerous O
intragenic O
Alu O

( O
41.5 O

the O
occurrence O
of O

, O
and O
with O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
pseudogene O
30 O

Several O
studies O
have O
described O
germline O
LGRs O
involving O
either O
Alu O
repeats O
or O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
pseudogene O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
only O
one O
LGR O
without O
involvement O
of O
these O
genetic O
structures O
has O
so O
far O
been O
reported O
. O

The O

these O

from O

According O
to O
Sluiter O
and O
van O
Rensburg O
the O
proportion O
of O
LGRs O
detected O
in O
the O
Hispanic O

is O
over O

as O
the O

It O
is O

that O

among O
the O

Notable O
is O
that O
her O

. O

The O
role O
of O
PALB2 B-gene
in O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
uncertain O
, O
as O
there O
have O
been O
few O
documented O
ovarian B-disease
carcinoma I-disease
cases O
harboring O
germline O
mutations O
in O
this O
gene O
. O

Two O
PALB2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
were O
identified O
in O
a O
study O
of O
339 O
unrelated O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
of O
Polish O
descent O
. O

The O
carriers O
had O
high O
grade O
carcinomas O
of O
different O
histopathological O
types O
: O
serous O
( O
case O
diagnosed O
at O
61 O
years O
) O
and O
endometrioid O
( O
case O
diagnosed O
at O
54 O
years O
) O
subtypes O
, O
where O
the O
latter O
carrier O
also O
harbored O
a O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

Two O
( O
0.6 O
% O
) O
PALB2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
were O
reported O
in O
a O
study O
of O
360 O
ovarian B-disease

that O
were O
also O
screened O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O

. O

Neither O
of O
these O
two O
high-grade O
serous O
carcinoma O
PALB2 B-gene
mutation-carriers O
( O
diagnosed O
at O
ages O
51 O
and O
58 O
) O
had O
a O
personal O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
although O
the O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
case O
diagnosed O
at O
age O
58 O
years O
had O
a O
family O
history O
of O

. O

A O
low O
frequency O
of O
PALB2 B-gene
carriers O
( O
0.4 O
% O

was O
also O
recently O
reported O
in O
an O
investigation O
of O
253 O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
from O
the O
Volga-Ural O
region O
of O
Russia O
, O
with O
the O
only O
carrier O
identified O
in O
this O
study O
having O
a O
bilateral O
( O
moderate O
grade O
) O
serous B-disease
ovarian I-disease
carcinoma I-disease
at O
age O
46 O
and O
a O
prior O
history O
of O
melanoma O
. O

The O
low O
frequency O
of O
PALB2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
identified O
thus O
far O
may O
argue O
a O
minor O
role O
for O
this O
gene O
in O
conferring O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
compared O
with O
higher O
frequency O
of O

carriers O
observed O
in O

cancer I-disease
cases O
and O

cancer I-disease
families O
. O

This O
is O
consistent O
with O
recent O
findings O
estimating O
that O
PALB2 B-gene
heterozygotes O
were O
1.3-fold O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
relative O
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
the O
context O
of O

family O
history O
. O

mutation O
did O
not O
exhibit O
evidence O
of O
LOH O
of O
the O
PALB2 B-gene
locus O
. O

This O
could O
also O
be O
consistent O
with O
sufficient O
contamination O
of O
normal O
stromal O
DNA O
such O
that O
it O
would O
obscure O
an O
imbalance O
of O

. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
PALB2 B-gene
contributes O
to O
carcinogenesis O
through O
haploinsufficiency O
and/or O
a O
dominant O
negative O
effect O
given O
the O
paucity O
of O

observed O
in O
the O
majority O
of O

from O
PALB2 B-gene

, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O

where O
a O
high O
frequency O

was O
seen O
[ O

The O
significance O
of O
these O
findings O
is O

the O

For O
the O

, O
however O
, O
the O

Conclusions O
Our O

that O
the O

can O
lie O

The O

the O

Background O
Breast B-disease

About O
10-20 O

are O
family O
clustered O

with O
multiple O
family O
members O

by O
the O

. O

Genetic O
predispositions O
are O
the O
major O
risk O

for O
the O
disease O
. O

However O
, O
the O

predispositions O
are O
currently O
known O
for O
only O
30-40 O
% O
of O
the O
familial B-disease

. O

The O
remaining O
60-70 O
% O
of O

have O
unknown O

, O
for O
their O

It O
is O
estimated O
the O
`` O
missing O
'' O

consists O
of O
thousands O

a O
minor O
disease O

. O

Indeed O
, O
broadly O
screening O
the O
variants O
across O
disease O
populations O
has O
uncovered O
multiple O
new O
genetic O

for O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

A O
consistent O
pattern O
among O
these O
newly O
classified O
predispositions O
is O
that O
they O
are O
always O
present O
at O
very-low O
frequencies O
in O
the O
given O
disease O
population O
. O

Their O
extreme O
rarity O
implies O
that O
a O
greater O
sampling O
size O
of O

populations O
is O
required O
to O
identify O
the O
germline O

However O
, O
such O
an O

to O
increase O
the O
complexity O
of O

As O
such O

Familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
defined O
as O
an O
autosomal O
dominant O
genetic O
disease O
. O

Although O
incidences O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
often O
exhibit O
atypical O
Mendelian O
patterns O
due O
to O
the O
factors O
such O
as O
low O
penetrance O
of O
genetic O
predispositions O
, O
the O
predisposition O
in O
a O
disease-prone O
family O
is O
expected O
to O
transmit O
across O

between O

members O
. O

Focusing O
on O
each O
disease O
family O
with O
a O
history O
of O
the O

is O
expected O
to O
improve O
the O
chance O

the O

a O
family O
compared O
to O
screening O
the O

which O
can O
dilute O
the O

. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
the O

are O
specific O
to O

Discussion O
The O
majority O
of O
families O
with O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
lack O
evidence O
for O
their O
genetic O
predispositions O
. O

Efforts O
in O
past O
decade O
have O
made O
slow O
progress O
in O
determining O
the O
unknown O
genetic O
predispositions O
. O

Currently O
, O
population-based O
approach O
is O
adapted O
as O
the O
major O
promising O
tool O
to O
reach O
the O
goal O
. O

One O
weakness O
of O
this O
approach O
is O
that O
it O
can O
`` O
dilute O
out O
the O
effects O
of O
a O
very O
strong O
association O
in O
a O
small O
subset O
of O
the O
study O
population O
'' O
. O

It O
requires O
a O
large-size O
disease O
population O
of O
over O
tens O
of O
thousands O
but O
the O
predispositions O
identified O
will O
likely O
remain O
very O
rare O
in O
the O
disease O
population O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
extreme O
rarity O
, O
such O
genetic O
predispositions O
are O
often O
difficult O
to O
confirm O
in O
different O
disease O
populations O
and O
to O
distinguish O
from O
normal O
polymorphisms O
. O

Our O
study O
observed O
the O
presence O
of O
family-specific O
, O
novel O
, O
deleterious O
variants O
, O
and O
putative O
predispositions O
in O

The O
information O
implies O
that O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
population-based O
approach O
, O
a O
family-based O
approach O
provides O
another O
option O
to O
determine O
the O
genetic O

Based O
on O

revealed O
in O
our O
study O

we O
propose O
a O
model O
to O
explain O
the O
genetic O

in O

In O
this O

the O

The O

Our O

rather O
than O
reach O
for O

We O
achieved O
this O
by O

( O
i.e. O
, O

Assignment O
of O
a O

Our O

are O
enriched O

such O
that O

suggesting O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
BRCAX O
MBCs B-disease
may O
be O
distinct O
and O
arise O
from O
different O
tumour O

. O

This O
has O
implications O
on O
potential O
therapies O
, O
depending O
on O
the O

Recent O
advances O
in O
next-generation O
sequencing O
technologies O
have O
made O
it O
possible O
to O
interrogate O
the O
molecular O
characteristics O
of O
individual O
cancers O
. O

Within O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
research O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
best O
contemporary O
example O
is O
the O
recent O
analysis O
of O
466 O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
by O
The O
Cancer O
Genome O
Atlas O
Network O
that O
integrated O
analysis O
from O
various O
molecular O
platforms O
to O
produce O
a O
comprehensive O
portrait O
of O
genetic O
and O
epigenetic O
alterations O
. O

Analysis O
revealed O
convergent O
changes O
leading O
to O
common O
gene O
circuits O
that O
correlated O
with O
luminal O
, O
HER2 O
and O
basal O
phenotypes O
as O
defined O
by O
mRNA O
profiling O
. O

Furthermore O
and O
importantly O
, O
from O
a O
therapeutic O
standpoint O
, O
a O
greater O
knowledge O
of O
genomic O
and O
potentially O
targetable O
drivers O
was O
ascertained O
. O

While O
the O
TCGA O
study O
contained O
eight O
male B-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
( O
MBCs B-disease
) O
, O
the O
analysis O
neither O
segregated O
nor O
commented O
on O
specific O
alterations O
in O
males O
. O

This O
is O
reflective O
of O
much O
of O
MBC B-disease
research O
where O
the O
study O
and O
treatment O
of O
these O
rarer O
tumours O
have O
been O
extrapolated O
from O
findings O
concluded O
from O
female B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
FBC B-disease
) O
studies O
. O

Overall O
, O
MBC B-disease
cancers O
comprise O
< O
1 O
% O
of O
all O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
but O
account O
for O
greater O
mortality O
. O

Traditionally O
, O
these O
tumours O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
most O
similar O
to O
peri/postmenopausal O
FBC B-disease
with O
a O
mean/median O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
5-10 O
years O
later O
than O
FBC B-disease
with O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
invasive B-disease
ductal I-disease
carcinomas I-disease
of O
no O
special O
type O
and O
high O
frequency O
of O
oestrogen/progesterone O
receptor O
( O
ER/PgR O
) O
positivity O
. O

However O
, O
unlike O
FBC B-disease
, O
there O
is O
a O
lower O
proportion O
of O
tumours O
of O
basal O
and O
possibly O
HER2 O
phenotypes O
and O
an O
absence O
of O
early O
onset O
cancers O
( O
< O
40 O
years O
of O
age O
) O
. O

Although O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
MBCs B-disease
arise O
in O
a O
setting O
of O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
the O
effect O
of O
being O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
is O
different O
from O
female O
gene O
carriers O
with O
a O
relative O
high O
penetrance O
seen O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
male O
carriers O
( O
10.3 O
% O
) O
but O
very O
low O
penetrance O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
male O
carriers O
( O
1.2 O
% O
) O
. O

Little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
risk O
factors O
and O
biology O
for O
MBC B-disease
, O
and O
to O
date O
most O
molecular O
studies O
have O
examined O
the O
germline O
for O
specific O
predisposing O
genes O
. O

There O
are O
few O
somatic O
studies O
that O
have O
interrogated O
chromosomal O
changes O
largely O
through O
array-based O
CGH O
, O
with O
some O
reported O
differences O
compared O
with O
FBC B-disease
. O

Only O
seven O
studies O
have O
specifically O
investigated O
MBCs B-disease
comprising O
a O
total O
of O
208 O
males O
, O
with O
all O
but O
one O
study O
not O
reporting O
on O
BRCA B-gene
status O
or O
family O
history O
of O
the O
patients B-species
. O

Furthermore O
, O
only O
a O
limited O
panel O
of O
genes O
have O
been O
examined O
, O
including O
PIK3CA B-gene
, O
TP53 B-gene
, O
KRAS B-gene
, O
BRAF B-gene
, O
androgen O
receptor O
( O
AR O
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
with O
some O
differences O
again O
noted O
from O
FBC B-disease
. O

While O
older O
studies O
suggest O
a O
similar O
frequency O
of O
TP53 B-gene
mutations O
( O
25-41 O
% O
range O
in O
MBCs B-disease
) O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
alterations O
( O
21 O
% O
) O
between O
MBC B-disease
and O
FBCs B-disease
, O
other O
MBCs B-disease
studies O
have O
been O
inconsistent O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
frequency O
of O
KRAS B-disease
mutations O
( O
0 O
% O
vs O
12 O
% O
) O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
some O
mutations O
, O
such O
as O
the O
PIK3CA B-gene
E547K B-mutation
mutation O
, O
appear O
to O
be O
overrepresented O
and O
potentially O
specific O
to O
MBCs B-disease
. O

As O
an O
extension O
from O
our O
previous O
study O
, O
we O
have O
therefore O
taken O
advantage O
of O
new O
technologies O
that O
are O

Although O
the O

relatively O
unknown O
, O
the O
panel O
also O

Discussion O
Our O

somatic O

in O
familial B-disease

occur O
at O
a O
lower O
overall O
frequency O
compared O
with O
FBC B-disease
, O
which O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
limited O
data O
from O
TCGA O
. O

However O
, O
the O
profile O
of O
mutations O
observed O
in O
this O
familial B-disease

cohort O
is O
similar O
to O
that O
seen O
in O
luminal/ER-positive O
FBCs O
with O
which O
they O
share O
common O
phenotypic O
features O
. O

The O
most O
common O
mutations O
identified O
in O

( O
where O

albeit O
at O

Considering O
that O
these O

in O
the O

of O
FBCs B-disease
, O
our O
results O
are O
somewhat O
expected O

that O
these O

are O
more O

( O

, O
a O

that O
are O

This O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
because O
of O
the O
lower O
incidence O
of O
lobular O
carcinoma O
in O
MBCs B-disease
( O
3 O

when O

, O
our O

Although O
an O

This O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
due O
to O
the O

which O
are O
largely O

thus O

suggesting O
that O

As O
most O

The O
loss O
of O

be O
because O
of O
its O

to O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene

, O
which O
is O
supported O
by O
sporadic B-disease

While O

in O

and O
thus O
suggesting O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
loss O
is O
a O
significant O
driver O
in O
MBC B-disease

Interestingly O
, O
also O

As O
this O

several O
tumour O

genes O
, O
it O
may O
suggest O
particular O
selection O
in O
BRCA2-deficient O
MBCs B-disease
. O

Alternately O
, O
as O
the O
tumour O
suppressor O
STK11/LKB1 O
may O
also O
enhance O
ERalpha O
response O
, O
it O
may O
be O
that O

may O
be O
oncogenic O
in O
some O
breast B-disease

subsets O
that O
may O
also O
include O

Notably O
, O
in O
our O
cohort O
we O
see O
just O
as O
many O
losses O
of O
STK11/LKB1 O
as O
FBC B-disease

imply O
a O
dual O
function O
for O
the O

The O
amplification O

loci O
in O

has O
not O
been O
reported O
in O
previous O
MBC B-disease

. O

The O
relevance O
of O
this O
finding O
is O
uncertain O
, O
but O
as O
SMARCB1 B-gene
is O
a O
tumour O
suppressor O
gene O
, O
it O
may O
be O
a O
bystander O
effect O
and O
may O
again O
reiterate O
the O
strength O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
drive O
in O
MBCs B-disease

This O
is O
also O
supported O

Conclusion O
This O
the O
first O
study O
to O
perform O
high-throughput O

It O
shows O
differences O

with O
the O
former O

and O
the O
latter O
containing O
frequent O
PIK3CA B-gene
mutations O
similar O
to O

A I-disease
FBCs I-disease
. O

Overall O
, O

was O

that O

Analysis O
of O

analysis O
also O
showed O
differences O
between O
BRCA2 B-gene

. O

While O
some O
gains O
and O
losses O
were O
similar O
to O
that O
reported O
previously O
in O
both O

and O
FBC B-disease
, O
we O
have O
identified O
specific O
gains O
that O
are O
particular O
to O
BRCA2 B-gene
tumours O
. O

Comparison O
of O
coexpressed O
genes O
also O
demonstrated O
differences O
between O

cases O
with O
a O
distinct O
concordance O
of O
tumour O
suppressor O
genes O
with O
BRCAX O
patients B-species
and O
more O
heterogeneity O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
cases O
. O

We O
also O
noted O
more O
gene O
losses O
than O
other O
previous O
MBC B-disease
studies O
, O
suggesting O
that O
familial B-disease
MBCs I-disease
may O
be O
a O
unique O
cohort O
among O
which O
difference O
exist O
between O

. O

Furthermore O
, O
from O
a O
future O

the O

suggest O
that O

How O

three O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
founder O
mutations O
Background O
Several O
founder O
mutations O
leading O
to O
increased O
risk O
of O
cancer O
among O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
individuals O
have O
been O

, O
and O
some O
estimates O

the O

the O
mutations O
have O
been O

A O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
have O
been O
used O
previously O
to O
estimate O
the O
age O
of O
the O
mutations O
. O

Here O
three O
datasets O
containing O
genotype O
information O
near O
known O
founder O
mutations O
are O
reanalyzed O
in O
order O
to O
compare O
three O
approaches O
for O
estimating O
the O
age O
of O
a O
mutation O
. O

The O
methods O
are O
: O
( O
a O
) O
the O
single O
marker O
method O
used O
by O
Risch O
et O
al. O
, O
( O
1995 O
) O
; O
( O

) O
the O
intra-allelic O

as O
DMLE O

and O
( O

) O
the O
Goldgar O
method O
proposed O
in O
Neuhausen O
et O
al O
. O
( O
1996 O
) O
, O
and O
modified O
slightly O
by O
our O
group O
. O

The O
three O
mutations O
analyzed O
were O
MSH2 B-gene

I1307K B-mutation
, O
and O

. O

Results O
All O
methods O
depend O
on O
accurate O
estimates O
of O
inter-marker O
recombination O
rates O
. O

The O
modified O
Goldgar O
method O
allows O
for O
marker O
mutation O
as O
well O
as O
recombination O
, O
but O
requires O
prior O
estimates O
of O
the O
possible O
haplotypes O
carrying O
the O
mutation O
for O
each O
individual O
. O

It O
does O
not O
incorporate O
population O
growth O
rates O
. O

The O
DMLE O
method O
simultaneously O
estimates O
the O
haplotypes O
with O
the O
mutation O
age O
, O
and O
builds O
in O
the O
population O
growth O
rate O
. O

The O
single O
marker O
estimates O
, O
however O
, O
are O
more O
sensitive O
to O
the O
recombination O
rates O
and O
are O
unstable O
. O

Mutation O

based O
on O
DMLE O
are O

Conclusions O
For O
recent O
founder O
mutations O
where O
marker O
mutations O
are O
unlikely O
to O
have O
occurred O
, O
both O
DMLE O
and O
the O
Goldgar O
method O
can O
give O
good O
results O
. O

Caution O
is O
necessary O
for O
older O
mutations O
, O
especially O
if O
the O
effective O
population O
size O
may O
have O
remained O
small O
for O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
. O

Background O
Several O
diseases O
occur O
at O
higher O
frequency O
among O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
individuals O
, O
and O
furthermore O
, O
specific O
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
that O
are O
at O
a O
higher O
frequency O
in O
this O
population O
than O
in O
other O
populations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
mutation O
BRCA2 B-gene
* O
6174delT B-mutation
is O
present O
in O
approximately O
1 O
% O
of O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jews I-species
, O
and O
is O
present O
at O
increased O
frequencies O
in O
early-onset O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
and O
families O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
mutation O
MSH2 B-gene
* O
1906 B-mutation
G- I-mutation
> I-mutation
C I-mutation
leads O
to O
increased O
risk O
of O
colorectal B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
individuals O
, O
and O
the O
colorectal B-disease
cancer-susceptibility O
allele O
APC B-gene
I1307K B-mutation
appears O
to O
confer O
a O
relative O
risk O
of O
1.5-2.0 O
for O
colorectal B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
CRC B-disease
) O
on O
carriers O
. O

For O
each O
of O
the O
above O
three O
mutations O
, O
cases O
carry O
a O
haplotype O
in O
common O
surrounding O
the O
mutation O
site O
, O
suggesting O
that O
all O
cases O
are O
descendants O
of O
a O
recent O
founder O
. O

It O
has O
been O
argued O
that O
the O
high O
frequency O
of O
some O
of O
these O
mutations O
is O
due O
to O
various O
population O
bottlenecks O
that O
the O
population O
has O
undergone O
over O
the O
centuries O
, O
leading O
to O
a O
unique O
genetic O
signature O
. O

It O
is O
, O
therefore O
, O
interesting O
to O
estimate O
the O
ages O
of O
these O
mutations O
in O
order O
to O
compare O
whether O
they O
arose O
at O
a O
similar O
period O
in O
the O
history O
of O
this O
population O
, O
or O
whether O
they O
have O
very O
different O
ancestries O
. O

Several O
quite O
different O
methods O
have O
been O
proposed O
for O
estimating O
mutation O
age O
, O
and O
hence O
here O
we O
evaluate O
and O
compare O
three O
approaches O
, O
and O
make O
recommendations O
as O
to O
when O
and O
where O
each O
method O
is O
preferable O
. O

The O
simplest O
method O
for O
estimating O
mutation O
age O
, O
proposed O
by O
Serre O
et O
al O
. O
( O
1990 O
) O
and O
popularized O
by O
Risch O
et O
al O
. O
( O
1995 O
) O
, O
is O
based O
on O
the O
expected O
decay O
of O
linkage O
disequilibrium O
due O
to O
recombination O
, O
between O
a O
marker O
and O
the O
mutation O
, O
over O
the O
generations O
between O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
mutation O
and O
today O
. O

However O
, O
consideration O
of O
gene O
genealogies O
and O
models O
for O
coalescent O
times O
for O
different O
chromosomal O
lineages O
can O
lead O
to O
richer O
models O
capable O
of O
incorporating O
population O
growth O
and O
accounting O
for O
the O
randomness O
of O
the O
gene O
genealogy O
. O

A O
simple O
model O
for O
gene O
genealogies O
is O
the O
star O
genealogy O
where O
all O
copies O
of O
the O
disease-causing O
mutation O
are O
assumed O
to O
have O
one O
common O
coalescent O
time O
. O

Under O
this O
model O
, O
all O
the O
histories O
of O
each O
copy O
of O
the O
mutation O
are O
independent O
of O
one O
another O
; O
this O
assumption O
is O
quite O
reasonable O
for O
fast-growing O
populations O
where O
the O
probability O
of O
two O
lineages O
merging O
is O
small O
. O

The O
simple O
estimate O
( O

) O
, O

) O
is O
the O
maximum O
likelihood O
estimate O
under O
this O
model O
. O

However O
, O
the O
star O
genealogy O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
realistic O
. O

Assuming O
a O
bifurcating O
genealogy O
where O
all O
lineages O
split O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Labuda O
et O
al O
. O
( O
1996 O
) O
showed O
that O
the O
estimate O
of O
Risch O
( O
1995 O
) O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
biased O
downwards O
. O

They O
developed O
a O
correction O
factor O
that O
increases O
the O
estimated O
age O
and O
accounts O
for O
the O
population O
growth O
rate O

A O
multiple-marker O
likelihood O
for O
estimating O
mutation O
age O
was O
implemented O
by O
Goldgar O
and O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O
age O
of O
several O
mutations O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

This O
likelihood-based O
method O
includes O
the O
effects O
of O
both O
recombination O
and O
mutation O
and O
allows O
for O
a O
particular O
mutation O
to O
occur O
independently O
more O
than O
once O
, O
but O
requires O
mutation-carrying O
haplotypes O
to O
be O
known O
. O

Different O
mutation O
rates O
can O
be O
set O
for O
different O
types O
of O
markers O
( O
e.g O
. O
dinucleotide O
, O
tetranucleotide O
) O
. O

Population O
growth O
is O
not O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

We O
modified O
this O
likelihood O
to O
allow O
for O
haplotype O
uncertainty O
; O
all O
possible O
mutation-carrying O
haplotypes O
were O
included O
in O
the O

together O
with O

Rannala O

Slatkin O
( O
1998 O

used O
a O
continuous-time O

to O
develop O
a O
likelihood O
for O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
intra-allelic O

a O

this O

for O
the O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
noting O
that O
their O
method O
estimates O
the O
time O
of O

the O
mutation O

which O
could O
be O
substantially O

the O

Datasets O
We O

for O
estimating O

using O
three O
datasets O
containing O
cases O
and O
controls O
of O

Firstly O
, O
we O
examined O

, O
two O

. O

The O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O

were O
randomly O
sampled O
individuals O
from O
Montreal O
whose O

was O
unknown O
at O
time O
of O

None O
of O
the O

were O
available O
for O

, O
including O
6 O

Previously O
, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
all O
cases O
carried O
an O

and O
furthermore O
that O
this O

. O

This O

will O
be O
referred O

Secondly O
, O
we O
analyzed O
56 O
cases O
of O

as O
part O
of O
a O

case-control O
study O
of O

In O
the O
original O
case-control O

but O
we O
focused O
on O
the O

In O
a O
genome-wide O

of O
8487 O
markers O
, O
two O
markers O
were O
identified O
near O
BRCA2 B-gene
with O
significantly O
different O
frequencies O
between O
cases O
and O

, O
after O
adjusting O
for O
multiple O

Neither O
of O
these O
two O

We O
examined O
several O

Discussion O
Estimating O
the O
age O
of O
founder O
mutations O
will O
always O
be O
an O
inexact O
endeavour O
. O

The O
true O
recombination O
and O
mutation O
history O
of O
the O
relevant O
chromosomal O
segments O
is O
unknown O
, O
and O
all O
models O
make O
strong O
assumptions O
that O
can O
not O
be O
verified O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
multi-marker O
approaches O
tend O
to O
give O
more O
consistent O
estimates O
than O
single O
marker O
estimates O
. O

For O
the O
latter O
, O
excellent O
recombination O
fraction O
estimates O
are O
crucial O
, O
and O
hence O
, O
estimates O
are O
particularly O
unreliable O
for O
markers O
very O
close O
to O
the O
mutation O
where O
the O
recombination O
fraction O
can O
not O
be O
well O
estimated O
. O

Since O
the O
single-marker O
estimates O
are O
based O
simply O
on O
the O
expected O
decay O
of O
one O
haplotype O
, O
no O
estimates O
can O
be O
obtained O
when O
the O
allele O
frequency O
on O
control O
chromosomes O
exceeds O
the O
allele O
frequency O
on O
the O
mutation-carrying O
chromosomes O
. O

To O
implement O
the O
likelihood O
and O
the O
single-marker O
methods O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
know O
which O
allele O
lies O
on O
the O
ancestral O
haplotype O
containing O
the O
mutation O
( O
the O
mutation-associated O
allele O
at O
each O
marker O
) O
. O

To O
obtain O
this O
information O
, O
we O
estimated O
haplotypes O
using O
PHASE O
and O
used O
haplotype O
predictions O
to O
estimate O
which O
were O
the O
associated O
alleles O
at O
each O
marker O
. O

For O
the O
single O
marker O
method O
, O
we O
used O
the O
most O
probable O
mutation-associated O
allele O
, O
but O
for O
our O
modification O
of O
Goldgar O
's O
likelihood O
method O
, O
we O
included O
all O
predicted O
mutation-carrying O
haplotypes O
, O
with O
their O
probabilities O
. O

The O
multi-marker O
likelihood O
for O
one O
haplotype O
is O
calculated O
by O
proceeding O
outwards O
from O
the O
known O
disease O
locus O
, O
while O
calculating O
the O
probabilities O
needed O
to O
explain O
the O
data O
at O
each O
new O
marker O
, O
assuming O
either O
recombination O
or O
mutation O
events O
as O
required O
; O
these O
are O
then O
combined O
in O
a O
weighted O
sum O
over O
the O
possible O
haplotypes O
. O

Although O
the O
result O
can O
be O
expected O
to O
underestimate O
the O
true O
mutation O
ages O
since O
population O
growth O
is O
not O
taken O
into O
account O
, O
we O
corrected O
the O
estimates O
for O
growth O
using O
the O
median O
of O
the O
single-marker O
Labuda O
growth O
rate O
corrections O
. O

Although O
this O
method O
incorporates O
parameters O
for O
mutation O
at O
each O
marker O
, O
unlike O
the O
DMLE O
model O
, O
over O
the O
time O
frames O
estimated O
for O
these O
three O
data O
sets O
, O
the O
probability O
of O
marker O
mutation O
or O
disease O
locus O
mutation O
is O
small O
. O

For O
older O
events O
and O
tightly O
linked O
markers O
, O
however O
, O
this O
method O
should O
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
methods O
based O
solely O
on O
recombination O
. O

The O
DMLE O
method O
estimates O
time O
to O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
mutation O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
most O
recent O
common O
ancestor O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
this O
method O
includes O
consideration O
of O
the O
possible O
variability O
in O
genealogies O
when O
calculating O
the O
posterior O
credible O
intervals O
. O

These O
two O
factors O
would O
lead O
one O
to O
expect O
wider O
confidence O
intervals O
and O
older O
age O
estimates O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
DMLE O
estimate O
, O
the O
MSH2 B-gene
mutation O
is O
estimated O
to O
be O
approximately O
17 O
generations O
old O
, O
or O
perhaps O
425 O
years O
old O
assuming O
25 O
years O
per O
generation O
, O
and O
the O
likelihood-based O
estimate O
is O
very O
similar O
. O

These O
estimates O
place O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
mutation O
about O
in O
the O
year O
1575 O
, O
during O
a O
period O
when O
the O
community O
was O
reasonably O
large O
and O
undergoing O
fast O
population O
growth O
. O

It O
is O
very O
plausible O
that O
any O
new O
mutation O
would O
become O
rapidly O
and O
widely O
disseminated O
under O
these O
conditions O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
we O
see O
substantial O
disparities O
between O
the O
two O
multi-marker O
methods O
for O
the O
other O
two O
mutations O
. O

The O
I1307K B-mutation
mutation O
is O
estimated O
by O
DMLE O
to O
have O
arisen O
in O
perhaps O
650 O
BCE O
( O
assuming O
r O
= O
1.125 O
) O
, O
yet O
at O
350 O
CE O
by O
the O
likelihood O
approach O
. O

Despite O
the O
large O
difference O
, O
these O
origin O
estimates O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
mutation O
was O
seen O
in O
several O
Jewish O
populations O
that O
are O
not O
Ashkenazi O
, O
but O
share O
a O
common O
haplotype O
around O
I1307K B-mutation
. O

In O
, O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
6174delT B-mutation
mutation O
was O
estimated O
to O
have O
arisen O
29 O
generations O
ago O
, O
using O
the O
original O
version O
of O
the O
likelihood O
method O
. O

Here O
, O
our O
estimates O
, O
using O
the O
modified O
likelihood O
method O
on O
new O
marker O
data O
and O
without O
correction O
for O
population O
growth O
, O
were O
quite O
a O
bit O
smaller O
( O
9-17 O
generations O
) O
, O
and O
the O
DMLE O
estimates O
( O
including O
corrections O
for O
growth O
) O
were O
substantially O
larger O
at O
60 O
or O
90 O
generations O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
choice O
of O
method O
, O
and O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
, O
the O
choice O
of O
markers O
, O
makes O
a O
substantial O
difference O
to O
the O
result O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
confidence O
intervals O
for O
the O
likelihood O
based O
approach O
are O
extremely O
wide O
and O
include O
the O
DMLE O
estimates O
and O
most O
of O
their O
credible O
intervals O
. O

Using O
DMLE O
, O
the O
6174delT B-mutation
mutation O
may O
have O
arisen O
at O
approximately O
200 O
BCE O
( O
r O
= O
1.125 O
) O
but O
the O
most O
recent O
common O
ancestor O
is O
estimated O
at O
1000 O
CE O
by O
the O
Goldgar O
likelihood O
( O
allowing O
for O
population O
growth O
) O
. O

The O
earlier O
estimate O
agrees O
perhaps O
better O
with O
the O
rare O
finding O
of O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
6174delT B-mutation
mutation O
in O
Sephardi B-species
Jews I-species
. O

How O
can O
these O
differences O
be O
reconciled O
? O

Since O
the O
DMLE O
method O
attempts O
to O
identify O
the O
time O
in O
history O
at O
which O
the O
mutation O
in O
question O
arose O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
most O
recent O
common O
ancestor O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
if O
a O
mutation O
were O
to O
arise O
in O
a O
relatively O
isolated O
Jewish O
community O
, O
it O
could O
be O
transmitted O
within O
that O
community O
for O
a O
substantial O
number O
of O
generations O
before O
branching O
out O
into O
ostensibly O
unrelated O
Jewish O
individuals O
. O

In O
this O
situation O
, O
the O
most O
recent O
common O
ancestor O
could O
be O
considerably O
closer O
to O
the O
current O
time O
than O
is O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
mutation O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
, O
while O
entirely O
speculative O
, O
could O
explain O
the O
data O
obtained O
here O
, O
wherein O
DMLE O
estimates O
for O
both O
the O
APC B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
place O
the O
origin O
of O
these O
mutations O
considerably O
further O
back O
in O
time O
than O
do O
the O
other O
methods O
. O

While O
it O
seems O
unlikely O
that O
the O
origin O
and O
wide O
dissemination O
of O
a O
mutation O
could O
be O
separated O
by O
more O
than O
1000 O
years O
, O
we O
do O
not O
know O
in O
what O
place O
or O
Jewish O
sub-group O
this O
mutation O
arose O
, O
and O
prolonged O
geographical O
or O
cultural O
isolation O
could O
potentially O
lead O
to O
such O
an O
effect O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
DMLE O
results O
change O
quite O
a O
lot O
when O
the O
growth O
rate O
is O
altered O
; O
it O
appears O
that O
a O
slower O
growth O
rate O
leads O
to O
much O
more O
potential O
variability O
in O
genealogies O
in O
this O
data O
set O
. O

We O
used O
simple O
estimates O
of O
recombination O
rates O
based O
on O
physical O
distance O
, O
and O
hence O
results O
based O
on O
the O
6 O
closest O
markers O
may O
be O
less O
accurate O
than O
those O
based O
on O
markers O
spanning O
a O
longer O
distance O
. O

The O
accuracy O
of O
any O
method O
will O
be O
only O
as O
good O
as O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
required O
parameters O
. O

Over O
short O
time O
scales O
( O
in O
evolutionary O
terms O
) O
such O
as O
those O
observed O
in O
all O
three O
of O
our O
data O
sets O
, O
mutation O
rates O
will O
be O
hard O
to O
estimate O
, O
and O
over O
short O
physical O
distances O
, O
recombination O
rates O
will O
be O
imprecise O
. O

Assuming O
that O
the O
chromosomal O
region O
of O
interest O
is O
well-behaved O
, O
the O
optimal O
set O
of O
markers O
to O
use O
when O
estimating O
age O
would O
include O
markers O
far O
enough O
away O
that O
the O
recombination O
fraction O
can O
be O
adequately O
estimated O
, O
yet O
not O
so O
far O
that O
the O
associated O
haplotype O
is O
no O
longer O
identifiable O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
growth O
rate O
of O
the O
population O
has O
a O
very O
large O
impact O
on O
the O
estimated O
age O
of O
the O
mutations O
. O

Over O
these O
time O
periods O
and O
for O
the O
Jewish O
population O
of O
these O
three O
data O
sets O
, O
some O
estimates O
of O
population O
size O
are O
available O
. O

However O
, O
the O
assumption O
of O
a O
constant O
growth O
rate O
over O
time O
, O
which O
is O
used O
in O
both O
the O
Labuda O
correction O
and O
in O
DMLE O
, O
is O
known O
to O
be O
untrue O
. O

The O
Ashkenazi O
population O
experienced O
distinct O
periods O
of O
fast O
population O
growth O
and O
subsequent O
population O
bottlenecks O
, O
and O
these O
events O
are O
not O
taken O
into O
account O
in O
the O
estimation O
of O
mutation O
age O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
since O
both O
DMLE O
and O
the O
Labuda O
correction O
assume O
constant O
growth O
rates O
, O
our O
comparison O
of O
methods O
is O
still O
interpretable O
. O

Some O
other O
approaches O
for O
estimating O
mutation O
age O
have O
been O
proposed O
. O

One O
method O
is O
based O
primarily O
on O
the O
rate O
of O
occurrence O
of O
mutations O
over O
time O
, O
near O
the O
locus O
of O
interest O
. O

This O
approach O
, O
which O
is O
implemented O
in O
the O
software O
BATWING O
, O
assumes O
no O
recombination O
, O
and O
hence O
is O
ideally O
suited O
to O
very O
small O
regions O
of O
the O
genome O
, O
or O
to O
mitochondrial O
DNA O
where O
there O
is O
no O
recombination O
. O

Since O
mutations O
occur O
quite O
rarely O
, O
this O
approach O
is O
particularly O
suited O
to O
estimating O
events O
that O
occurred O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

A O
more O
recent O
approach O
examines O
haplotype O
sharing O
between O
individuals O
, O
and O
constructs O
a O
phylogenetic O
tree O
from O
the O
similarity O
matrix O
. O

This O
approach O
is O
less O
dependent O
on O
linkage O
disequilibrium O
, O
but O
does O
not O
take O
the O
possible O
variability O
in O
the O
genealogies O
into O
account O
. O

mutation O
is O
primarily O
of O
academic O
interest O
, O
however O
, O
it O
does O
provide O
some O
insights O
into O
demography O
and O
history O
in O
special O
populations O
. O

Several O
different O
models O
have O
been O
proposed O
for O
estimating O
mutation O
age O
. O

We O
have O
demonstrated O
here O
that O
single O
marker O
, O
likelihood-based O
, O
or O
coalescent-based O
methods O
are O
likely O
to O
agree O
well O
when O
a O
mutation O
is O
young O
and O
the O
population O
is O
fast-growing O
. O

However O
, O
for O
older O
mutations O
, O
different O
methods O
will O
give O
more O
variable O
results O
. O

If O
some O
of O
the O
markers O
are O
likely O
to O
mutate O
, O
then O
our O
modified O
Goldgar O
likelihood O
is O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

However O
, O
in O
general O
, O
the O
coalescent O
model O
implemented O
in O
DMLE O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
representation O
of O
the O
gene O
genealogies O
and O
their O
variability O
. O

This O
has O
been O
recently O
demonstrated O
in O
a O
study O
where O
the O
date O
of O
origin O
of O
a O
recent O
mutation O
was O
known O
, O
and O
the O
DMLE O
estimate O
was O
very O
accurate O
. O

Methods O
Population O
allele O
frequencies O
were O
estimated O
by O
allele O
counting O
in O
control O
individuals O
. O

When O
haplotypes O
were O
required O
, O
we O
used O
the O
PHASE O
algorithm O
to O
estimate O
the O
distribution O
of O
possible O
haplotypes O
for O
each O
individual O
. O

Mutation-carrying O
haplotypes O
were O
then O
selected O
from O
these O
distributions O
, O
together O
with O
their O
probabilities O
. O

Population O
growth O
rates O
were O
estimated O
using O
formula O
; O
p1 O
= O
p0 O
* O
rg O
. O

Here O
, O
g O
is O
the O
number O
of O
generations O
, O
p1 O
and O
p0 O
are O
the O
population O
sizes O
at O
different O
times O
, O
and O
the O
growth O
rate O
is O
er O
-fold O
per O
generation O
. O

From O
, O
in O
the O
year O
1900 O
, O
there O
were O
5,000,000 O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
individuals O
, O
and O
there O
were O
560,000 O
in O
the O
year O
1765 O
. O

Therefore O
the O
growth O
rate O
was O
approximately O
1.5-fold O
per O
generation O
( O
assuming O
25 O
years O
per O
generation O
) O
over O
this O
period O
. O

This O
fast O
growth O
likely O
started O
near O
the O
year O
1500 O
, O
when O
there O
were O
estimated O
to O
be O
approximately O
11,000 O
Jewish O
people B-species
in O
a O
north-eastern O
European O
region O
; O
again O
the O
growth O
rate O
up O
to O
the O
year O
1900 O
can O
be O
estimated O
to O
be O
near O
1.5 O
. O

However O
, O
prior O
to O
the O
year O
1500 O
there O
are O
little O
data O
on O
the O
size O
of O
the O
Jewish O
population O
, O
which O
probably O
fluctuated O
but O
remained O
small O
. O

We O
assumed O
lower O
growth O
rate O
estimates O
of O
1.125 O
and O
1.21 O
for O
analyses O
of O
older O
mutations O
. O

The O
former O
figure O
was O
obtained O
by O
assuming O
the O
population O
was O
near O
11,000 O
in O
the O
year O
600 O
, O
and O
grew O
to O
5 O
million O
in O
the O
year O
1900 O
. O

The O
latter O
figure O
was O
obtained O
under O
the O
same O
assumptions O
but O
assuming O
the O
population O
was O
11,000 O
in O
the O
year O
1100 O
. O

Niell O

( O

) O
also O
used O
an O
estimated O
growth O
rate O
of O
1.125-fold O

, O
although O
they O
assumed O
this O

applied O
between O

and O

it O
can O
vary O

The O

of O
this O

is O
to O
summarize O
current O

about O
the O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

For O
the O

only O
the O

considered O

excluding O
as O

the O
unclassified O
variants O
that O
could O
not O
be O
clearly O
related O
with O
pathogenicity O
. O

For O
the O
consistency O
, O
the O
unequivocal O
term O
`` O
founder O
'' O
is O
used O
for O
those O
mutations O
where O
haplotype O
studies O
revealed O
shared O
polymorphic O
markers O
consistent O
with O

, O
or O
when O

were O
repeatedly O
identified O
( O
at O

3 O
times O
) O
. O

Some O
mutations O
previously O
described O
as O

mutations O
in O
one O
country O
, O
subsequently O
are O
found O
at O
a O
higher O
proportion O
in O
other O
countries/regions O
as O
true O
founders O
. O

These O
mutations O
in O
adjacent O
countries O
will O
likely O
reflect O
the O
gradient O
transition O
from O
the O
`` O

'' O
over O
the O
time O
due O
to O
historical O
co-existence O

although O

. O

Rs2736098 B-mutation
is O
located O
in O
coding O
sequence O
of O
TERT B-gene
gene O
, O
therefore O
it O
has O
been O
considered O
as O
a O
putative O
cancer O
susceptibility O
gene O
. O

TERT B-gene
encodes O
the O
catalytic O
subunit O
of O
telomerase O
, O
which O
is O
crucial O
in O
cellular O
proliferation O
because O
counteracts O
telomere-dependent O
replicative O

. O

In O
many O
types O

cancer O
, O
TERT B-gene
shows O
a O
high-level O
of O
expression O

which O
possibly O
induces O
excessive O
cell O
growth O
and O

. O

Although O

is O
a O
synonymous O
polymorphism O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
correlated O
with O
telomere O

, O
however O
not O
with O
TERT B-gene

On O
the O

in O

Therefore O
, O
rs2736098 B-mutation
might O
be O
just O
a O
tagging O
SNP O

causal O
variant O
. O

To O
our O

, O
this O
is O
the O

Our O

One O
of O
possible O

that O

Introduction O
African O

that O

the O

The O

In O

Similarly O

accounted O
for O

60 O
% O

Using O

the O
estimate O

the O
prevalence O

in O
the O
rapidly O
expanding O
number O
of O
cancer O

will O
also O
vary O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
these O
massively O
parallel O
sequencing O
panels O
indeed O
prove O
their O
useful O
implementation O
in O
clinics O
and O
confirm O
that O
genes O
involved O
in O
DNA O
repair O
pathways O
, O
including O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
major O
genes O
contributing O
to O
inherited O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
in O
African O
American O
populations O
. O

The O
limited O
information O
about O
family O
history O
of O
cancer O
in O
several O
of O
these O
patients B-species
reflects O
a O
general O
problem O
. O

Of O
patients B-species
meeting O
selection O
criteria O
other O
than O
family O
history O
( O
i.e. O
, O
selected O
for O
young O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
or O
TNBC B-disease
) O
, O
48 O
% O
( O
64/133 O
) O
had O
very O
limited O
information O
about O
cancers O
in O
previous O
generations O
of O
their O
families O
. O

This O
problem O
likely O
reflects O
historical O
disparities O
in O
access O
to O
medical O
care O
and O
strongly O
suggests O
that O
criteria O
other O
than O
family O
history O
should O
be O
widely O
recognized O
by O
clinicians O
and O
sufficient O
for O
referral O
for O
genomic O
testing O
. O

As O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
women B-species
and O
women B-species
of O
European O
ancestry O
, O
our O
results O
suggest O
that O
African O
American O
women B-species
with O
young O
age O
at O
onset O
, O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
or O
TNBC B-disease
could O
benefit O
very O
substantially O
from O
genomic O
testing O
. O

Identifying O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
is O
important O
for O
at O
least O
three O
reasons O
. O

Patients B-species
with O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
genes O
involved O
in O
DNA O
repair O
pathways O
may O
be O
treated O
with O
synthetic O
lethal O
therapeutic O
approaches O
based O
on O
poly-ADP-ribose O
polymerase O
inhibitors O
( O
PARPi O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
women B-species
with O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
and O
PALB2 B-gene
should O
be O
advised O
about O
risk-reducing O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
each O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patient B-species
with O
inherited O
disease O
represents O
a O
family O
including O
as-yet-unaffected O
sisters O
and O
daughters O
and O
nieces O
for O
whom O
genetic O
knowledge O
can O
empower O
cancer O
prevention O
. O

Increased O
focus O
on O
cancer O
control O
and O
prevention O
to O
improve O
population O
health O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
reduce O
cost O
of O
care O
for O
advanced O
disease O
in O
underserved O
populations O
. O

Despite O
its O
limitation O
as O
a O
single O
institution O
study O
, O
this O
study O
speaks O
to O
a O
fundamental O
problem O
of O
disparities O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
outcomes O
among O
African O
American O
women B-species
. O

African O
American O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
are O
more O
likely O
than O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
of O
other O
ancestries O
to O
be O
affected O
at O
a O
young O
age O
; O
to O
develop O
aggressive O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
; O
and O
to O
die O
from O
their O
disease O
. O

It O
is O
also O
known O
that O
patients B-species
with O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
diagnosed O
at O
a O
young O
age O
. O

The O
distribution O
of O
genetic O
and O
non-genetic O
risk O
factors O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
not O
uniform O
across O
populations O
and O
there O
is O
significant O
heterogeneity O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
one O
potential O
contributor O
to O
the O
higher O
incidence O
of O
aggressive O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
among O
African O
American O
patients B-species
is O
a O
higher O
burden O
of O
previously O
understudied O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
susceptibility O
genes O
. O

In O
order O
to O
test O
this O
hypothesis O
rigorously O
, O
taking O
into O
consideration O
the O
significant O
genetic O
diversity O
in O
the O
African O
Diaspora O
, O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
evaluate O
large O
, O
population-based O
cohorts O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
of O
African O
and O
other O
ancestries O
, O
including O
both O
comprehensive O
genomic O
analysis O
and O
thorough O
characterization O
of O
patient B-species
history O
, O
tumor O
characteristics O
, O
treatment O
, O
and O
survival O
. O

Our O
study O
addressed O
the O
converse O
question O
: O
the O
frequency O
of O
mutations O
given O
family O
history O
or O
young-onset O
aggressive O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

We O
suggest O
that O
the O
mutation O
frequency O
of O
approximately O
25 O
% O
among O
African O
American O
patients B-species
with O
these O
features O
underscores O
the O
need O
for O
larger O
studies O
among O
women B-species
from O
diverse O
populations O
. O

Heretofore O
, O
high O
cost O
and O
insurance O
coverage O
has O
been O
a O
major O
barrier O
to O
incorporating O
genomic O
testing O
into O
clinical O
cancer O
care O
. O

Targeted O

and O
multiplexed O
sequencing O
offers O
the O
capacity O
to O
sequence O
multiple O
relevant O
genes O
at O
once O
, O
in O
a O
single O
test O
, O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
order O
sequential O
genetic O
tests O
at O
a O
cost O
of O
thousands O
of O
dollars O
per O
gene O
. O

The O
cost O
of O
genetic O
testing O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
predisposition O
should O
drop O
quickly O
in O
a O
competitive O
marketplace O
, O
allowing O
more O
equitable O

. O

Diffusion O

the O
potential O
to O
accelerate O

, O
improve O

In O

previous O
nationwide O

A O

examined O
the O

factors O
among O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

. O

Recently O
, O
the O
KOHBRA O
Study O
evaluated O
the O
factors O
affecting O
the O
decision O
to O
undergo O
RRSO O
among O
women B-species
with O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
a O
single O
institution O
. O

Among O
71 O
carriers O
eligible O
for O
RRSO O
, O
29.6 O
% O
underwent O
RRSO O
. O

Although O
the O
uptake O
rate O
of O
RRSO O
in O
this O
particular O
institution O
was O
relatively O
high O
compared O
with O
that O
in O
other O
hospitals O
in O
Korea O
, O
it O
was O
lower O
than O
the O
rates O
in O
Western O
countries O
. O

The O
rate O
of O
RRSO O
was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
the O
fifth O
decade O
of O
life O
( O
52.6 O
% O
) O
than O
in O
the O
fourth O
decade O
of O
life O
( O
33.3 O
% O
) O
and O
sixth O
and O
later O
decades O
of O
life O
( O
10.7 O
% O
) O
. O

The O
rate O
of O
RRSO O
uptake O
was O
higher O
in O
carriers O
with O
a O
personal O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
than O
in O
those O
without O
a O
personal O

( O
39.2 O
% O
vs. O
5.0 O

, O
p=0.004 O
) O
. O

A O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
was O
also O
associated O
with O
the O
uptake O
of O
RRSO O
in O
univariate O
analysis O
. O

The O
multivariate O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
age O
( O
fourth O
and O
fifth O
decades O
of O
life O
) O
and O
personal O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
were O
independent O
factors O

the O
uptake O
of O
RRSO O
. O

Therefore O
, O
age O
, O
personal O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
and O
other O
factors O
affecting O
the O
decision O
to O

RRSO O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
the O

. O

This O
study O
was O
limited O
by O
the O
small O

. O

Despite O
these O
limitations O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O
evaluate O
the O
RRSO O

FUTURE O
OF O
THE O
KOHBRA O
STUDY O
The O
KOHBRA O
Study O
established O
the O
prevalence O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
Korean O
population O
according O
to O
risk O
factors O
, O
which O
will O
help O
healthcare O
providers O
select O
proper O
candidates O
for O
BRCA B-gene

. O

The O
risks O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
by O
age O
70 O
years O
in O
Korean O
BRCA B-gene

are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Western O
populations O
. O

Although O
the O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
, O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
cancer O
prevention O
strategies O
based O
on O
the O
penetrance O

. O

In O
the O
KOHBRA O
Study O
, O
we O
confirmed O
that O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
, O
2 O
widely O
used O
Western O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O

, O
underestimated O
the O
risk O
of O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
Koreans B-species
. O

Therefore O
, O
a O
new O
BRCA B-gene
risk O
calculator O
was O
developed O
for O
the O
Korean O
population O
. O

We O
determined O
the O
status O
of O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
management O
for O
HBOC B-disease
, O
the O
psychological O
impact O
of O
genetic O

, O
and O
familial O
communication O
about O
HBOC B-disease
in O
Korea O
by O
conducting O
various O
surveys O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
information O
, O
we O
explored O
methods O
to O
improve O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
management O
strategies O
for O
HBOC B-disease
. O

To O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
genetic O
counseling O
, O
the O
KOHBRA O
Study O
group O
developed O
a O
nationwide O

; O
developed O
a O
textbook O
, O
a O

for O
HBOC B-disease
; O
and O
created O
a O
certification O
system O
and O
training O
courses O
for O
genetic O
counselors O
. O

The O
KOHBRA O
Study O
group O
performed O
various O
domestic O
and O
international O
collaborative O
studies O
to O
identify O
genetic O
variants O
associated O
with O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
through O

studies O
. O

We O
are O

INTRODUCTION O
Sequence-based O
testing O
of O
high-risk O
disease-susceptibility O
genes O
in O
clinical O
and O
research O
contexts O
usually O
identifies O
a O
large O
number O
of O
genetic O
variants O
which O
are O
neither O
clearly O
pathogenic O
nor O
clearly O
benign O
. O

Carriers O
of O
such O
variants O
of O
unknown O
significance O
( O
VUSs O
) O
can O
not O
be O
given O
definite O
information O
about O
their O
risks O
of O
disease O
, O
and O
the O
appropriate O
clinical O
management O
of O
such O
carriers O
is O
debatable O
. O

Most O
VUSs O
are O
missense O
variants O
which O
result O
in O
the O
change O
of O
a O
single O
amino O
acid O
in O
the O
protein O
product O
of O
the O
gene O
. O

The O
occurrence O
of O
a O
VUS O
in O
a O
series O
of O
multiple-case O
families O
does O
not O
imply O
that O
the O
VUS O
confers O
a O
high O
risk O
of O
disease O
unless O
it O
is O
known O
that O
the O
VUS O
occurs O
more O
rarely O
in O
comparable O
families O
without O
family O
histories O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

Some O
VUSs O
are O
sufficiently O
common O
that O
their O
associated O
risks O
of O
disease O
can O
be O
estimated O
but O
most O
VUSs O
are O
rare O
, O
so O
direct O
risk O
estimates O
are O
not O
possible O
. O

A O
number O
of O
methods O
exist O
to O
predict O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
individual O
VUSs O
based O
on O
the O
predicted O
effect O
of O
the O
variant O
on O
the O
encoded O
protein O
and/or O
the O
level O
of O
sequence O
conservation O
at O
the O
variant O
's O
homologous O
sites O
in O
non-human O
species O
. O

These O
classification O
methods O
can O
be O
used O
to O
classify O
individual O
VUSs O
into O
nominally O
'low O
' O
, O
'medium O
' O
or O
'high O
' O
risk O
categories O
, O
but O
the O
actual O
disease O
risks O
conferred O
by O
variants O
in O
these O
categories O
are O
unknown O
. O

In O
this O
paper O
, O
we O
use O
penetrance O
analysis O
to O
estimate O
the O
average O
risks O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
certain O
classes O
of O
VUSs O
, O
such O
as O
the O
set O
of O
all O
VUSs O
classified O
as O
'high O
risk O
' O
by O
a O
given O
method O
. O

We O
suggest O
that O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
further O
information O
about O
an O
individual O
VUS O
, O
these O
average O
risks O
can O
be O
used O
for O
the O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
clinical O
management O
of O
a O
carrier O
of O
any O
VUS O
in O
the O
class O
. O

This O
is O
in O
line O
with O
current O
clinical O
practice O
for O
deleterious O
mutations O
, O
where O
even O
though O
disease O
risks O
might O
vary O
from O
mutation O
to O
mutation O
, O
the O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
clinical O
management O
of O
carriers O
is O
uniform O
across O
this O
class O
of O
variants O
, O
and O
is O
based O
on O
average O
risks O
obtained O
from O
pooled O
analyses O
of O
families O
with O
different O
mutations O
. O

We O

DISCUSSION O
We O
have O
shown O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
estimate O
cancer O
risks O
for O
groups O
of O
VUSs O
by O
combining O
existing O
classification O
methods O
with O
traditional O
penetrance O
analyses O
. O

The O
estimated O
HRs O
give O
the O
average O
risks O
for O
all O
variants O
placed O
into O
a O
given O
risk O
class O
by O
a O
given O
classification O
method O
, O
just O
as O
estimated O
HRs O
for O
deleterious O
mutations O
are O
the O
average O
across O
the O
class O
of O
all O
such O
variants O
. O

We O
suggest O
that O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
information O
about O
an O
individual O
VUS O
other O
than O
its O
nominal O
predictive O
risk O
class O
, O
these O
average O
risks O
can O
be O
used O
for O
the O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
clinical O
management O
of O
a O
carrier O
of O
any O
VUS O
in O
the O
class O
. O

They O
constitute O
the O
best O
evidence O
available O
, O
just O
as O
an O
estimate O
of O
average O
risk O
for O
the O
group O
of O
protein-truncating O
mutations O
is O
the O
best O
evidence O
available O
for O
counseling O
those O
carriers O
, O
even O
though O
their O
specific O
mutation O
might O
never O
have O
been O
previously O
observed O
. O

Application O
of O
this O
method O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
risks O
gave O
weak O
evidence O
that O
missense O
variants O
at O
highly O
conserved O
sites O
are O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
p=0.05 O
) O
. O

It O
also O
showed O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
increases O
with O
the O
degree O
of O
sequence O
conservation O
( O
p=0.03 O
) O
. O

This O
analysis O
also O
suggested O
that O
variants O
in O
the O
'high O
risk O
' O
category O
of O
A-GVGD O
have O
risks O
close O
to O
those O
of O
mutations O
, O
although O
the O
confidence O
interval O
for O
this O
estimate O
was O
too O
wide O
to O
draw O
definite O
conclusions O
, O
so O
these O
results O
should O
not O
be O
put O
into O
clinical O
practice O
unless O
confirmed O
by O
larger O
studies O
. O

We O
also O
showed O
that O
female O
carriers O
of O
variants O
classified O
as O
'low O
risk O
' O
by O
a O
given O
classification O
method O
will O
, O
on O
average O
, O
have O
incidences O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
at O
most O
2.3 O
times O
the O
population O
incidences O
( O
and O
possibly O
no O
higher O
than O
for O
the O
population O
) O
. O

This O
upper O
bound O
provides O
some O
certainty O
and O
reassurance O
to O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
female O
VUS O
carriers O
whose O
VUSs O
are O
classified O
as O
'low O
risk O
' O
by O
a O
given O
classification O
method O
. O

is O

by O
comparing O

Their O
method O
therefore O
estimates O
the O

, O
while O
our O
method O
estimates O
the O

Since O
on O

half O
of O

will O
not O
carry O
a O

the O

should O
be O
approximately O
equal O

where O

Therefore O
their O

Encouragingly O

since O

, O
though O
the O

means O
that O
this O

could O

Relative O
strengths O
of O
our O
method O
over O
that O
of O
Akbari O
et O

. O
include O
our O
direct O
estimation O
of O
the O
main O
quantity O
of O
interest O
, O
theta O
, O
our O
ability O
to O
rigorously O
adjust O

our O
ability O
to O
reduce O
bias O
in O
penetrance O
estimates O
by O
incorporating O
residual O
familial O
aggregation O
of O
cancer O
. O

Our O
estimates O
quantify O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
VUS O
on O
top O
of O
an O
unmeasured O
polygenic O
background O
of O
breast B-disease

. O

Including O
a O
polygenic O
background O
was O
necessary O
because O
simulation O
has O
shown O
that O

to O
use O
a O
mixed O
model O
or O
to O
otherwise O
account O
for O
residual O

Since O
the O
polygenic O
background O
can O
be O
thought O
of O
as O
capturing O
a O
woman B-species
's O
family O
history O
of O

, O
her O
incidence O
of O
breast B-disease

should O
be O
calculated O
as O
the O
relevant O
HR O
for O
her O
VUS O
multiplied O
by O
both O
the O
population O

and O
a O
factor O
reflecting O
her O

e.g O

a O
factor O

approximately O
2 O
if O
she O

. O

Strengths O
of O
our O
study O
include O
the O
population-based O
study O
design O
and O
the O
powerful O
and O
rigorous O
statistical O
methods O
used O
. O

Weaknesses O
include O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
for O
each O
VUS O
classification O
method O
, O
relatively O
few O
families O
had O
VUSs O
that O
were O
classed O
as O
'high O
risk O
' O
, O
leading O
to O
imprecision O
in O
the O
resulting O
HR O
estimates O
. O

This O
problem O
was O
exacerbated O
by O
the O
relative O
rarity O
of O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
giving O
us O
little O
statistical O
power O
to O
detect O
increased O
risks O
for O
this O

. O

In O
summary O
, O
we O
have O
given O
a O
method O
to O
estimate O
cancer O
risks O
for O
groups O
of O
VUSs O
by O
combining O
existing O
classification O
methods O
with O
traditional O
penetrance O

. O

This O
analysis O
suggests O
that O
classification O
methods O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
variants O
based O
on O
sequence O
conservation O
might O
be O
useful O
in O
a O
clinical O
setting O
and O
that O
, O
on O
average O
, O
variants O

as O
'low O

' O
increase O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risks O
by O
at O
most O

. O

We O
have O
shown O
in O

that O
our O
method O
can O
be O
used O
to O
classify O

The O
molecular O
diagnosis O
of O
mutations O

implies O
high O

Unfortunately O

is O
not O
always O
available O
in O

As O

, O
the O
current O
strategies O

Discussion O
Molecular O
genetic O
testing O
of O
germline O
mutations O
in O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
is O
not O
common O
in O
public O
institutions O
in O
Latin O
America O
due O
to O
its O
high O
costs O
and O
limitations O
in O
infrastructure O
. O

Current O
protocols O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
detection O
are O
time O
consuming O
and O
laborious O
, O
which O
makes O
difficult O
their O
implementation O
in O
developing O
countries O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
polymorphic O
nature O
of O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
, O
their O
long O
size O
and O
lack O
of O
hot O
mutation O
spots O
highlight O
the O
necessity O
to O
implement O
new O
high O
throughput O
diagnostic O
methodologies O
. O

Almost O
10 O
% O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
associated O
to O
hereditary O
mutations O
. O

Likewise O
, O
the O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
is O
been O
reported O
as O
high O
as O
80 O
% O
and O
50 O
% O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
, O
respectively O
; O
although O
it O
varies O
between O
different O
populations O
and O
ethnicities O
. O

In O
this O
light O
, O
BRCA B-gene
genetic O
testing O
is O
of O
major O
diagnostic O
relevance O
not O
only O
because O
it O
provides O
a O
clinical O
preventive O
approach O
to O
family O
members O
before O
the O
development O
of O
cancer O
, O
but O
also O
can O
imply O
novel O
treatment O
strategies O
for O
affected O
patients B-species
, O
such O
as O
the O
use O
of O
poly- O
( O
ADP-ribose O
) O
polymerase O
inhibitors O
. O

Additionally O
, O
BRCA B-gene
genetic O
tests O
are O
central O
for O
the O
determination O
of O
founder O
mutations O
, O
which O
are O
frequent O
deleterious O
variants O
that O
can O
be O
screened O
in O
the O
population O
in O
first-line O
directed O
studies O
to O
reduce O
costs O
and O
accelerate O
diagnosis O
. O

In O
the O
Mexican O
population O
no O
founder O
mutations O
have O
been O
described O
. O

In O
these O
work O
we O
analysed O
BRCA B-gene
full O
exome O
and O
splice O
site O
mutations O
by O
massive O
parallel O
pyrosequencing O
. O

In O
the O
evaluation O
of O
the O
method O
, O
we O
found O
all O
the O
mutations O
present O
in O
previously O
characterized O
positive O
controls O
; O
negative O
controls O
showed O
no O
variants O
. O

The O
coverage O
of O
the O
sequences O
for O
the O
mutations O
varied O
from O
41 O
to O
485X O
, O
with O
quality O
scores O
of O
20-40 O
in O
95 O
% O
of O
the O
reads O
throughout O
all O
the O
exonic O
and O
splice O
sites O
regions O
. O

These O
results O
led O
us O
to O
evaluate O
mutations O
in O
patients B-species
with O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
syndrome I-disease
and O
in O
patients B-species
with O
clinical O
features O
suggestive O
for O
BRCA B-gene
deleterious O
mutations O
. O

In O
these O
analyses O
we O
found O
4 O
( O
10.2 O
% O
) O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
39 O
patients B-species
, O
which O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
prevalence O
reported O
by O
other O
studies O
of O
families O
with O
hereditary O
cancer O
in O
Latin O
America O
. O

All O
the O
mutations O
found O
in O
these O
patients B-species
have O
not O
been O
previously O
described O
and O
are O
not O
reported O
in O
the O
Breast O
Cancer O
Information O
core O
( O
BIC O
) O
and O
NCBI O
variant O
databases O
, O
which O
is O
in O
concordance O
with O
the O
polymorphic O
nature O
of O
these O
genes O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
one O
of O
these O
mutations O
was O
in O
a O
patient B-species
with O
no O
history O
of O
familial O
cancer O
, O
but O
with O
strong O
suggestive O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
, O
such O
as O
early-onset O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

This O
result O
highlights O
the O
necessity O
to O
extend O
the O
screening O
for O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
also O
to O
candidate O
patients B-species
with O
no O
history O
of O
familial O
cancer O
, O
which O
is O
in O
concordance O
with O
reports O
that O
described O
that O
30-50 O
% O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
have O
not O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Remarkably O
, O
we O
found O
10 O
clinically O
asymptomatic O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
( O
c.5114_5117delTAAA B-mutation
) O
carriers O
in O
family O
1 O
, O
which O
reflects O
the O
incomplete O
penetrance O
associated O
with O
different O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
and O
that O
there O
are O
other O
risk O
factors O
associated O
with O
the O
penetrance O
of O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

In O
this O
study O
we O
used O
massive O
parallel O
pyrosequencing O
because O
its O
capacity O
to O
screen O
the O
whole O
exonic O
and O
splice O
site O
regions O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
up O
to O
8 O
samples O
per O
run O
and O
its O
high O
depth O
of O
sequence O
, O
which O
provides O
more O
sensitivity O
for O
mutation O
detection O
than O
conventional O
Sanger O
sequencing O
and O
makes O
this O
strategy O
cost-effective O
. O

Also O
, O
these O
advantages O
offer O
great O
benefit O
to O
the O
diagnostic O
scenario O
, O
comparing O
to O
other O
methods O
. O

However O
, O
this O
technology O
has O
intrinsic O
limitations O
, O
namely O
the O
detection O
of O
whole O
exon O
deletions O
and O
the O
identification O
of O
mutations O
in O
homopolymeric O
tracts O
longer O
than O
6 O
bases O
. O

Since O
the O
frequency O
of O
exon O
deletion O
and O
large O
genomic O
rearrangements O
is O
population-dependent O
and O
has O
been O
described O
as O
1-30 O
% O
in O
BRCA-associated O
cancers O
, O
it O
is O
determinant O
to O
further O
evaluate O
putative O
BRCA B-gene
mutation-negative O
samples O
by O
complementary O
methods O
, O
such O
as O
Multiplex O
Ligation-dependent O
Probe O
Amplification O
analysis O
. O

Also O
the O
evaluation O
of O
homopolymeric O
tract O
variants O
, O
which O
comprise O
12 O
stretches O
longer O
than O
6 O
nt O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
coding O
sequences O
, O
should O
be O
assessed O
with O
alternative O
methods O
such O
as O
high-resolution-melting-curve-analysis O
. O

When O
negative O
, O
these O
analyzes O
would O
rule O
out O
the O
BRCA B-gene
etiology O
of O
the O
tumor O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
these O
patients B-species
with O
clear O
familial O
history O
of O
cancer O
, O
the O
evaluation O
of O
mutations O
in O
other O
genes O
, O
like O
PALB2 B-gene
, O
CHEK2 B-gene
and O
RAD51C B-gene
, O
should O
also O
be O
considered O
. O

This O
could O
be O
the O
case O
of O
some O
of O
the O
families O
of O
this O
study O
, O
in O
which O
we O
screened O
35 O
patients B-species
with O
a O
clear O
familial O
history O
of O
cancer O
, O
but O
we O
only O
found O
3 O
patients B-species
with O
mutations O
in O
BRCA B-gene
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
VUS O
could O
be O
related O
to O
pathogenic O
effects O
at O
the O
level O
of O
mRNA O
processing O
, O
stability O
, O
translation O
and O
protein O
function O
, O
as O
has O
been O
described O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
other O
genes O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
VUS O
is O
subject O
of O
great O
interest O
as O
their O
presence O
exceeds O
mutations O
in O
patients B-species
with O
familial O
cancer O
; O
however O
, O
their O
functional O
evaluation O
is O
far O
from O
being O
a O
common O
diagnostic O
practice O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
functional O
evaluation O
of O
some O
VUS O
in O
the O
BRCA B-gene
genes O
has O
showed O
that O
single O
nucleotide O
variations O
in O
introns O
can O
influence O
mRNA O
processing O
, O
producing O
exon O
skipping O
and O
aberrant O
out O
of O
frame O
mRNA O
forms O
. O

We O
found O
16 O
not O
previously O
described O
VUS O
, O
especially O
in O
patients B-species
without O
deleterious O
BRCA B-gene
variants O
and O
4 O
were O
predicted O
to O
be O
pathogenic O
by O
computational O
analyses O
. O

Functional O
studies O
must O
be O
undertaken O
to O
evaluate O
their O
effects O
. O

In O
this O
concern O
, O
we O
foresee O
that O
new O
routine O
methods O
will O
soon O
be O
accessible O
to O
determine O
the O
molecular O
and O
pathological O
relevance O
of O
these O
variants O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
this O
work O
illustrates O
how O
hole O
exonic O
and O
splice O
site O
massive O
parallel O
pyrosequencing O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
diagnostic O
strategy O
to O
determine O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
. O

Its O
use O
circumvents O
the O
laborious O
and O
time-consuming O
efforts O
of O
the O
current O
methodologies O
. O

With O
this O
technology O
we O
found O
4 O
mutations O
and O
16 O
VUS O
in O
our O
series O
of O
patients B-species

, O
which O
highlights O
the O

of O
this O

Between O

13.000 O

fulfilling O
the O

While O

in O
approximately O
24 O

of O

( O

, O
a O

, O
as O

are O
not O

Even O
though O

are O
available O
, O
evaluation O
of O
UCV O
that O
possibly O
affect O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
pre-mRNA O
processing O
is O
challenging O
as O
it O
frequently O
requires O
experimental O
validation O
. O

Numerous O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
splicing O

have O
been O
identified O
by O
using O
either O
mRNA O
derived O
from O
mutation O
carriers O
or O
by O
employing O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
minigene O

. O

The O
majority O
of O
these O
studies O
focuses O
on O
variants O
located O
within O
or O
in O
the O
close O
proximity O
of O
intronic O
splice O
sites O
only O
, O
suggesting O
that O
many O
mutations O
located O
deeper O
in O
the O
intron O
or O
exon O
that O
impair O
proper O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
pre-mRNA O
processing O
remain O
elusive O
. O

Today O
, O
there O
is O
ample O
evidence O
that O
disease-causing O
splicing O
mutations O
are O
more O
prevalent O
than O
previously O
expected O
. O

An O
often-cited O
estimate O
of O
15 O
% O
reflects O
only O
mutations O
that O
are O
known O
to O
affect O
the O
splice O
sites O
. O

When O
assayed O
directly O
for O
individual O
genes O
, O
up O
to O
50 O
% O
of O
disease-causing O
mutations O
are O
found O
to O
affect O
splicing O
and O
it O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
even O
60 O
% O
of O
mutations O
that O
cause O
disease O
do O
so O
by O
disrupting O
splicing O
. O

This O
discrepancy O
is O
due O
to O
the O
finding O
that O
many O
human B-species
disease O
genes O
harbour O
exonic O
alterations O
that O
affect O
pre-mRNA O
splicing O
. O

Nonsense O
, O
missense O
and O
even O
translationally O

mutations O
can O
impair O
gene O
activity O
by O
inducing O
the O
splicing O
machinery O
to O
skip O
the O
mutation-bearing O
exons O
. O

However O
, O
only O
a O
few O
exonic O
splicing O
mutations O
within O
BRCA1 B-gene
have O
been O
reported O

putative O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

both O
intronic O

Introduction O
Risk O
factors O
for O

, O
socioeconomic O
status O
, O
reproductive O

hormones O
, O
lifestyle O
factors O
, O
breast O

and O
family O
history O
of O
breast O
and O
other O
cancers O
. O

Approximately O
5-10 O
% O
of O
all O
breast B-disease
cancers I-disease
occur O
due O
to O
the O
inheritance O
of O
rare O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
highly O
penetrant O
predisposition O
genes O
, O
such O
as O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

Women B-species
carrying O
a O
deleterious O
mutation O
in O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
genes O
are O
at O
a O
substantially O
higher O
lifetime O
risk O
of O
developing O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
compared O
to O
the O
general O
population O
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
are O
also O
at O
reportedly O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
developing O
other O
cancers O
, O
including O
prostate B-disease
, I-disease
colon I-disease
, I-disease
stomach I-disease
, I-disease
melanoma I-disease
and I-disease
pancreatic I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
account O
for O
approximately O
16 O
% O
of O
the O
familial O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
managing O
hereditary O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
increased O
surveillance O
, O
prophylactic O
surgery O
and O
chemopreventative O
interventions O
are O
among O
the O
options O
available O
to O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
. O

Research O
has O
shown O
that O
those O
who O
are O
educated O
about O
their O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
are O
more O
likely O
to O
engage O
in O
risk-reducing O
behaviors O
and O
early O
detection O
strategies O
such O
as O
monthly O
self-breast O
exam O
, O
physician O
visits O
, O
mammography O
and O
breast O
MRI O
screening O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
use O
of O
chemo- O
and O
or O
surgical- O
preventive O
measures O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
cancer O
surveillance O
, O
has O
a O
positive O
impact O
on O
survival O
in O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

In O
newly O
diagnosed O
cancer O
patients B-species
, O
BRCA B-gene
testing O
was O
also O
shown O
to O
affect O
surgical O
decision-making O
. O

The O
benefits O
of O
Cancer O
risk O
assessment O
and O
BRCA B-gene
testing O
also O
extend O
to O
other O
family O
members O
. O

Cancer O
risk O
assessment O
can O
differentiate O
between O
those O
at O
high O
risk O
and O
those O
at O
average O
risk O
, O
thus O
relieving O
fears O
and O
anxieties O
about O
impending O
cancer O
, O
and O
sparing O
some O
individuals O
from O
unnecessary O
risk O
reducing O
options O
such O
as O
prophylactic O
surgeries O
. O

Cancer O
risk O
counseling O
and O
genetic O
testing O
serves O
to O
educate O
individuals O
about O
inherited O
predisposition O
to O
develop O
breast O
and O
other O
cancers O
. O

Throughout O
most O
of O
the O
United O
States O
, O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
testing O
is O
typically O
offered O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
or O
their O
family O
members O
based O
on O
the O
risk O
of O
carrying O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
estimated O
by O
personal O
and O
family O
history O
of O
cancer O
. O

This O
is O

also O
been O
shown O
to O
modify O
the O

. O

For O
example O
, O
individuals O

are O
at O
significantly O
higher O
risk O

carrying O
a O
BRCA B-gene

Several O
statistical O
models O
have O
been O
developed O
to O
predict O
the O

BRCA B-gene
mutation O
based O
on O
an O
individual O
's O
personal O
and O
family O
history O
. O

The O
BRCAPRO O
model O
uses O
a O
Bayesian O
approach O
, O
incorporating O
the O
autosomal O
dominant O
Mendelian O
characteristics O
of O
the O
genes O
, O
and O
the O
prevalence O
and O
penetrance O
of O
BRCA B-gene

The O
Myriad O
tables O
are O
derived O
from O
empiric O
data O
derived O
from O
individuals O
undergoing O
BRCA B-gene

. O

For O
a O
given O
family O
history O
, O
both O
models O
compute O
higher O
likelihood O
of O
identifying O
a O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
in O
individuals O
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
descent O
. O

However O
, O
they O
fail O
to O
recognize O
that O
other O
ancestries O
may O
also O
be O
associated O
with O

, O
Hispanics O
make O
up O
16.3 O

Even O
though O

Discussion O
A O

number O
of O

have O
looked O
at O
the O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
distribution O
, O
prevalence O
and O
penetrance O
in O
U.S. O
Hispanic O
populations O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
study O
describing O
BRCA B-gene
testing O
and O
results O
in O
the O
Hispanic O
population O
of O
Puerto O
Rico O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
, O
the O
most O
frequent O
mutation O
encountered O
was O
the O
E1308X B-mutation
nonsense O
mutation O
in O
exon O
11 O
of O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
which O
was O
previously O
reported O
as O
a O
recurrent O
mutation O
in O
Latin O
America O
and O
the O
Caribbean O
. O

This O
mutation O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
in O
Chilean O
families O
and O
US O
Hispanics O
. O

We O
also O
noted O
recurrence O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

A O
total O
of O
6 O

were O
identified O
, O
3 O
of O
them O
explaining O
more O
than O
three-fourths O
of O
the O
positive O
cases O
. O

The O
recurrent O
mutations O
were O
observed O
in O
apparently O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
but O
a O
possible O
founder O
effect O
can O
not O
be O
excluded O
. O

In O
Ashkenazi B-species

, O
three O
recurrent O
founder O
mutations O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
present O
at O
higher O
frequency O
and O
account O
for O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
the O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Founder O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
in O

from O
Iceland O
, O

, O
Great-Britain O
, O
Netherlands O
, O
Norway O
, O

, O
and O
Sweden O
, O
among O
others O
. O

Based O
on O
those O
observations O
, O
a O
simplified O
screening O
panel O
has O
been O
developed O
for O
initial O
mutation O
analyses O
in O
some O
of O
those O
populations O
. O

From O
a O
cost-effective O
standpoint O
, O
the O
development O
of O
a O
similar O
test O
panel O
may O
benefit O
the O
population O
of O
Puerto O
Rico O
if O
these O
results O
can O
be O
replicated O
in O
a O
larger O
population O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
187delAG B-mutation
mutation O
in O
our O
study O
population O
. O

This O
mutation O
is O
known O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
three O
most O
prevalent O
mutations O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
population O
, O
but O
is O
also O
reportedly O
the O
most O
frequent O
mutation O
in O
several O
Hispanic O
populations O
including O
Hispanics B-species
from O
California O
and O
Texas O
. O

It O
was O
also O
observed O
in O
Chilean O
, O
but O
not O
in O
Colombian O
or O
Mexican O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
. O

Its O
origin O
in O
the O
Hispanic O
population O
may O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
Spain O
as O
it O
was O
also O
detected O
in O
non-Jewish O
families O
from O
Spain O
. O

The O
presence O
of O
few O
recurrent O
BRCA B-gene
mutations O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
mutations O
commonly O
observed O
in O
other O
Hispanic O
populations O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
genetic O
bottleneck O
effect O
that O
are O
expected O
to O
have O
occurred O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
colonization O
of O
the O
New O
World O
by O
European O
and O
African O
ancestral O
populations O
. O

In O
the O
US O
, O
the O
term O
` O
Hispanic O
' O
refers O
mostly O
a O
heterogeneous O
group O
that O
shares O
a O
common O
culture O
and O
language O
. O

While O
most O
Hispanic O
populations O
are O
expected O
to O
be O
a O
mix O
of O
3 O
ancestral O
populations O
( O
African O
, O
European O
and O
Native O
American O
) O
, O
the O
relative O
proportion O
of O
each O
ancestral O
genetic O
background O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
vary O
within O
and O
across O
Hispanic O
populations O
. O

Previous O
studies O
using O
Ancestry O
Informative O
Markers O
( O
AIMs O
) O
have O
shown O
that O
Puerto O
Ricans O
carry O
more O
European O
and O
African O
ancestry O
, O
but O
significantly O
less O
Native O
American O
ancestry O
when O
compared O
to O
Mexicans O
. O

There O
are O
limitations O
to O
the O
current O
study O
design O
and O
recruitment O
strategy O
: O
the O
small O
sample O
size O
, O
retrospective O
ascertainment O
and O
recruitment O
, O
and O
testing O
limited O
almost O
exclusively O
to O
women B-species
with O
a O
personal O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Previous O
admixture O
analysis O
has O
shown O
that O
ancestral O
genetic O
background O
is O
influenced O
by O
geography O
and O
socio-economic O
status O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
. O

The O
recruitment O
of O
patients B-species
that O
have O
had O
access O
to O
genetic O
testing O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
selection O
of O
subjects O
of O
higher O
socioeconomic O
status O
, O
and O
consequently O
stronger O
European O
ancestry O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
recruitment O
was O
concentrated O
in O
a O
few O
offices O
in O
the O
San O
Juan O
metropolitan O
area O
, O
which O
is O
home O
to O
half O
of O
the O
population O
of O
the O
island O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
ancestral O
background O
of O
the O
study O
sample O
may O
not O
be O
representative O
of O
that O
of O
the O
island O
. O

Additional O
samples O
from O
other O
areas O
of O
Puerto O
Rico O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
generalize O
these O
findings O
. O

The O
small O
sample O
size O
of O
this O
study O
also O
limits O
the O
conclusion O
to O
be O
drawn O
. O

First O
, O
because O
of O
the O
limited O
number O
of O
participants B-species
, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
we O
have O
detected O
all O
the O
mutations O
present O
in O
the O
population O
. O

More O

in O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene

also O
require O
larger O
sample O
sizes O
. O

The O
BRCA B-gene
carrier O
frequency O
was O
47.8 O
% O
in O
this O
sample O
. O

However O
, O
this O
number O
may O
reflect O
a O
tendency O
of O
the O
medical O
professionals O
to O
recommend O
testing O
in O
higher-risk O
women B-species
and/or O
an O
increased O
likelihood O
of O
insurance O
coverage O
in O
higher O
risk O
women B-species
. O

description O
of O
the O
mutation O
spectrum O
and O
accurate O
evaluation O
of O
BRCA B-gene
carrier O
frequencies O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
will O
require O
the O
analysis O
of O
a O
larger O
, O
unselected O
group O
of O
women B-species
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
obtained O
higher O
carrier O
prediction O
scores O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

This O
might O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
higher O
ages O
at O
the O
time O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
diagnosis O
observed O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
one O
of O
the O
BRCA2 B-gene
cases O
produced O
a O
carrier O
risk O
of O
less O
than O
5 O
% O
for O
both O
prediction O
models O
( O
Myriad O
II O
and O
BRCAPRO O
) O
. O

This O
same O
case O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
54 O
years O
of O
age O
and O
would O
not O
meet O
the O
NCCN O
guidelines O
for O
genetic O
testing O
. O

Two O
additional O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
cases O
were O
predicted O
to O
have O
a O
risk O
below O
10 O
% O
using O
both O
models O
, O
but O
would O
have O
qualified O
for O
testing O
under O
the O
NCCN O
guidelines O
due O
to O
their O
young O
ages O
of O
diagnosis O
( O
42 O
and O
33 O
years O
of O
age O
) O
, O
even O
in O
absence O
of O
family O
history O
. O

Therefore O
, O
according O
to O
the O
currently O
available O
models O
and O
national O
guidelines O
for O
making O
genetic O
testing O
decision O
, O
1 O
out O
of O
9 O
BRCA2 B-gene
carriers O
would O
have O
gone O
untested O
in O
this O
sample O
. O

However O
, O
our O
sample O
size O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
draw O
general O
conclusion O
about O
the O
specificity O
and O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
models O
and O
national O
guidelines O
in O
this O
population O
. O

The O
BRCAPRO O
and O
Myriad O
II O
models O
have O
been O
developed O
based O
mostly O
on O
empiric O
data O
from O
populations O
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
and O
European O
descent O
. O

Assuming O
that O
mutation O
rates O
may O
vary O
across O
different O
populations O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
prediction O
models O
would O
need O
to O
be O
validated O
in O
other O
populations O
. O

BRCAPRO O
was O
shown O
to O
perform O
equally O
well O
in O
African O
American O
families O
as O
in O
white O
and O
Jewish O
families O
. O

In O
Asian B-species
Americans I-species
, O
Myriad O
II O
and O
BRCAPRO O
underestimated O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
by O
two-fold O
. O

In O
Hispanic O
populations O
, O
the O
validation O
of O
carrier O
risk O
estimation O
models O
has O
produced O
mixed O
results O
. O

A O
study O
of O
Hispanics B-species
from O
Texas O
reported O
a O
good O
discrimination O
of O
BRCA B-gene
carrier O
with O
BRCAPRO O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O
San O
Francisco O
Bay O
area O
this O
model O
showed O
the O
poorest O
performance O
in O
Hispanics O
. O

Although O
these O
inconsistencies O
may O
result O
from O
methodological O
differences O
between O
studies O
, O
they O
may O
also O
reflect O
variations O
in O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
frequencies O
and O
penetrance O
among O
the O
different O
Hispanic O
subgroups O
. O

Further O
studies O
will O
be O
required O
to O
fully O
validate O
the O
specificity O
and O
sensitivity O
of O
existing O
models O
for O
risk O
estimates O
in O
non-white O
women B-species
. O

For O
women B-species
receiving O
a O
positive O
BRCA B-gene
test O
result O
, O
several O
options O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
risk O
management O
are O
available O
, O
including O
increased O
surveillance O
, O
chemoprevention O
and O
prophylactic O
surgery O
. O

The O
limited O
resources O
available O
in O
genetic O
counseling O
impact O
the O
current O
cancer O
management O
model O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
, O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
are O
identified O
through O
surgery O
or O
oncology O
practices O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
BRCA B-gene
carriers O
are O
often O
identified O
after O
receiving O
a O
cancer O
diagnosis O
and O
the O
genetic O
test O
results O
may O
not O
always O
be O
available O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
making O
treatment O
decision O
. O

Previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
hereditary O
cancer O
counseling O
and O
testing O
is O
likely O
to O
impact O
surgical O
treatment O
decisions O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
preventive O
strategies O
such O
as O
tamoxifen O
and O
prophylactic O
surgeries O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
a O
greater O
impact O
on O
survival O
and O
quality-adjusted O
survival O
when O
initiated O
at O
earlier O
ages O
. O

In O
Puerto O
Rico O
, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
having O
a O
health O
care O
provider O
recommendation O
was O
an O
important O
factor O
in O
the O
decision O
to O
undergo O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
genetic O
testing O
. O

The O
establishment O
of O
cancer O
genetic O
education O
programs O
for O
community O
clinicians O
can O
impact O
knowledge O
and O
practice O
. O

Such O
programs O
could O
allow O
identifying O
individuals O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
hereditary O
cancer O
earlier O
and O
more O
efficiently O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
. O

The O
National O
Cancer O
Institute O
Cancer O
Genetics O
Services O
Directory O
lists O
only O
one O
cancer O
genetics O
professional O
for O
Puerto O
Rico O
. O

Even O
though O
medical O
geneticists O
that O
are O
not O
specialized O
in O
cancer O
may O
also O
facilitate O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
testing O
, O
these O
services O
are O
also O
limited O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
. O

Given O
the O
high O
proportions O
of O
carriers O
identified O
in O
this O
sample O
, O
more O
cancer O
genetic O
specialists O
will O
be O
required O
to O
serve O
this O
potentially O
high-risk O
population O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
we O
presented O
the O
first O
report O
identifying O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
. O

Our O
data O
and O
that O
of O
others O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
BRCA B-gene
mutation O
prevalence O
and O
spectrum O
may O
vary O
dramatically O
between O
different O
Hispanic O
and O
Caribbean O
populations O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
appear O
to O
be O
significant O
barriers O
to O
BRCA B-gene
genetic O
testing O
in O
this O
population O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
tests O
sent O
to O
Myriad O
Genetics O
have O
been O
canceled O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
insurance O
coverage O
. O

In O
a O
study O
exploring O
women B-species
's O
interests O
and O
attitudes O
towards O
genetic O
counseling O
and O
testing O
for O
genetic O
testing O
, O
Puerto O
Rican O
women B-species
expressed O
a O
high O
overall O
interest O
for O
hereditary B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
genetic O
testing O
but O
perceived O
the O
associated O
cost O
as O
the O
main O
barrier O
. O

If O
the O
recurrence O
of O
a O
subset O
of O
mutations O
is O
confirmed O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
, O
a O
cost-effective O
screening O
approach O
prior O
to O
the O
comprehensive O
sequence O

may O
be O
feasible O
in O
this O

This O
may O
contribute O
to O

cancer O
death O
among O
women B-species

comprise O
approximately O
5-10 O
% O
of O
all O

whereas O
familial B-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
accounts O
for O
10 O
% O
of O
invasive O

BRCA1 B-gene

BRCA2 B-gene
are O
the O
most O
well-known O
genes O
predisposing O

, O
have O
been O

; O
however O
they O
only O
account O
for O
a O

Recently O
, O
RAD51C B-gene

At O
the O

time O
, O
a O
biallelic O

RAD51C B-gene
was O
reported O
in O
a O

multiple O
severe O

characteristic O
of O
Fanconi B-disease

observed O
in O
five O
studies O

. O

No O
clearly O
pathogenic O

Thus O
, O
there O
are O
multiple O
studies O

that O
RAD51C B-gene

that O

As O

the O

Similarly O
, O

Discussion O
It O
has O
been O
well O
established O
that O
deficient O
DNA O
repair O
and O
specifically O
, O
homologous O
recombination O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
cancer O
susceptibility O
. O

RAD51C O
is O
involved O
in O
two O
specific O
subcomplexes O
, O
one O
with O
XRCC2 O
, O
RAD51B O
, O
and O
RAD51D O
, O
and O
the O
other O
with O
XRCC3 O
, O
and O
has O
multiple O
functions O
in O
the O
DNA O
damage O
response O
and O
the O
maintenance O
of O
genomic O
stability O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
RAD51C B-gene
is O
located O
in O
chromosomal O
region O
17q23 O
, O
which O
is O
amplified O
in O
primary O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
tumors I-disease
, O
but O
it O
had O
n't O
been O
investigated O
previously O
as O
a O
susceptibility O
locus O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Further O
confirmation O
of O
its O
role O
in O
breast B-disease
tumors I-disease
was O
the O
discovery O
that O
the O
MCF-7 O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cell O
line O
contains O
a O
RAD51C-ATXN7 O
fusion O
gene O
consisting O
of O
RAD51C B-gene
exons O
1-7 O
and O
ATXN7 B-gene
exons O
6-13 O
. O

Other O
RAD51 O
gene O
family O
members O
had O
been O
associated O
with O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
but O
there O
had O
been O
no O
reports O
implicating O
RAD51C B-gene
. O

To O
further O
investigate O
the O
role O
of O
RAD51C B-gene
as O
an O
HBOC B-disease
predisposition O
gene O
, O
we O
performed O
complete O
sequencing O
of O
RAD51C B-gene
to O
screen O
for O
mutations O
in O
286 O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2-negative O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
with O
a O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Fifteen O
variants O
were O
identified O
, O
of O
which O
we O
selected O
four O
non-synonymous O
variants O
for O
functional O
studies O
; O
RAD51C-G153D O
and O
RAD51C-T287A O
because O
they O
alter O
highly O
conserved O
amino O
acid O
residues O
( O
predicted O
to O
be O
pathogenic O
by O
SIFT O
and O
Polyphen O
) O
, O
RAD51C-A126T O
because O
it O
alters O
an O
amino O
acid O
in O
the O
Walker O
A O
box O
, O
and O
RAD51C-R214C O
because O
it O
alters O
an O
amino O
acid O
that O
separates O
a O
beta-strand O
from O
an O
alpha-helix O
. O

Yeast B-species
two-hybrid O
and O
immunoblot O
assays O
indicated O
that O
the O
RAD51C-T287A O
and O
RAD51C-A126T O
mutations O
do O
not O
substantially O
alter O
either O
the O
ability O
of O
RAD51C O
to O
interact O
with O
its O
companion O
proteins O
or O
its O
steady-state O
level O
, O
consistent O
with O
the O
results O
of O
the O
functional O
assays O
of O
Meindl O
at O
al O
.. O
Furthermore O
, O
these O
two O
variants O
have O
been O
identified O
multiple O
times O
in O
other O
studies O
, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
are O
benign O
polymorphisms O
. O

However O
, O
the O
results O
of O
the O
yeast B-species
two-hybrid O
and O
immunoblot O
assays O
were O
consistent O
with O
RAD51C-G153D O
being O
a O
pathogenic O
mutation O
as O
it O
led O
to O
undetectable O
levels O
of O
interaction O
between O
RAD51C O
and O
both O
XRCC3 O
and O
RAD51B O
, O
but O
did O
not O
markedly O
change O
levels O
of O
RAD51C O
. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
RAD51C-G153D O
mutation O
critically O
alters O
the O
ability O
of O
RAD51C O
to O
interact O
with O
XRCC3 O
and O
RAD51B O
, O
although O
it O
is O
not O
in O
a O
region O
of O
known O
secondary O
structure O
. O

RAD51C-R214C O
may O
be O
a O
hypomorphic O
mutation O
of O
uncertain O
clinical O
significance O
. O

Small O
but O
significant O
reductions O
in O
interaction O
between O
RAD51C O
and O
both O
XRCC3 O
and O
RAD51B O
were O
observed O
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
marked O
changes O
in O
the O
steady-state O
level O
of O
RAD51C O
( O
Figures O
1 O
and O
2 O
) O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there O
were O
no O
additional O
samples O
in O
the O
families O
in O
order O
to O
investigate O
cosegregation O
with O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
or O
tumor O
tissue O
to O
determine O
if O
there O
was O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
of O
the O
wild-type O
allele O
. O

RAD51C B-gene
first O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
rare O
hereditary B-disease

ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
HBOC B-disease
) O
predisposition O

by O
Meindl O

.. O
After O
discovering O
that O
it O
was O
associated O
with O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
, O
they O
screened O
for O
mutations O
in O
RAD51C B-gene
in O
1100 O
hereditary O
breast O
( O
HBC B-disease
) O
and O
HBOC B-disease
families O
, O
hypothesizing O
that O
it O
would O
be O
similar O
to O
BRIP1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
which O
biallelic O
mutations O
cause O
Fanconi B-disease
anemia I-disease
and O
monoallelic O
mutations O
cause O
HBOC B-disease
. O

They O
identified O
14 O
monoallelic O
germline O
mutations O
of O
which O
6 O
were O
considered O
pathogenic O
. O

The O
mutations O
were O
only O
identified O
in O
cases O
from O
families O
with O
both O
breast B-disease
and I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancers I-disease
( O
6/480 O

and O
in O
no O
cases O
from O
families O
with O
only O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
( O
0/620 O

. O

In O
a O
Spanish O
study O
of O
492 O
BRCA1- O
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
tested-negative O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
with O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
and/or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
they O
identified O
12 O
variants O
, O
of O
which O
one O
was O
clearly O
pathogenic O
in O
the O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
one O
case O
was O
of O
Swedish O
origin O
, O
and O
this O
mutation O
was O
recently O
reported O
in O
an O

in O
a O

of O
Swedish O
and O
Finnish O
familial B-disease

That O
study O
also O
reported O
a O
second O
clearly O
pathogenic O
mutation O
in O
an O
HBOC B-disease
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
case O
. O

In O
a O
recent O
Finnish O
study O
, O
two O
recurrent O
deleterious O
mutations O
were O
identified O
, O
and O
specifically O
in O
those O
with O
a O
personal O
or O

history O
of O
ovarian B-disease

In O
a O
Chinese O
study O
of O
275 O
women B-species
from O
HBOC B-disease

, O
two O
possibly O
pathogenic O
mutations O
were O

. O

In O
two O

92 O
breast B-disease

ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
from O
HBOC B-disease
families O
, O
no O
pathogenic O
mutations O
were O
found O
. O

RAD51C B-gene
mutations O
appear O
to O
be O
rare O
mutations O
that O
predispose O
to O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease

as O
well O
as O
to O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
but O
only O
in O
families O
with O
ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
we O
identified O
one O
likely O
pathogenic O
mutation O
and O
one O
hypomorphic O
mutation O
. O

These O
unique O
mutations O
had O
not O

was O
found O
in O
a O

was O
subsequently O
sequenced O

of O
the O
PALB2 B-gene

The O

turned O
out O

a O

The O
insertion O

This O

patient B-species
who O
also O
carried O
the O
novel O
BRCA1 B-gene

c.927delA B-mutation
, O
and O
therefore O
is O
a O
double O

in O
both O

The O

diagnosed O
with O
a O

and O
she O
has O
shown O
no O

three O

One O
of O
her O
three O

We O
finally O
considered O
BRD7 B-gene
as O
a O
plausible O
candidate O
gene O
for O
TNBC B-disease
, O
based O
on O
the O

Discussion O
Triple-negative B-disease
breast I-disease
cancers I-disease
( O
TNBCs B-disease
) O
have O
received O
much O
interest O
at O
the O
clinical O
, O
biological O
and O
epidemiological O
level O
due O
to O
the O
aggressive O
behaviour O
of O
the O
tumour O
, O
the O
poor O
prognosis O
and O
the O
present O
inapplicability O
of O
therapies O
with O
receptor O
antagonists O
. O

Among O
new O
therapies O
that O
are O
under O
investigation O
, O
the O
most O
important O
one O
is O
PARP O
inhibition O
, O
which O
induces O
synthetic O
lethality O
in O
tumour O
cells O
deficient O
in O
homology-directed O
DNA O
double-strand O
break O
repair O
such O
as O
cells O
mutated O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
mutated O
tumours O
are O
often O
triple-negative O
, O
and O
the O
treatment O
with O
PARP O
inhibitors O
might O
be O
promising O
in O
at O
least O
some O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
. O

Several O
recent O
studies O
on O
TNBC B-disease
have O
focussed O
on O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
whereas O
the O
prevalence O
of O
mutations O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
or O
mutations O
in O
other O
genes O
of O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene
pathway O
has O
been O
less O
extensively O
studied O
. O

This O
prompted O
us O
to O
perform O
a O
full O
scanning O
of O
the O
coding O
region O
of O
BRCA1 B-gene
, O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
PALB2 B-gene
and O
BRD7 B-gene
in O
a O
consecutive O
series O
of O
German O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
who O
have O
visited O
our O
hospital O
over O
a O
two-years-period O
. O

BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
exons O
were O
analysed O
using O
a O
Fluidigm O
Access O
Array O
followed O
by O
454 O
sequencing O
to O
save O
costs O
and O
to O
achieve O
a O
high O
throughput O
. O

Combining O
a O
microfluidic O
amplification O
system O
with O
massive O
parallel O
sequencing O
is O
an O
effective O
method O
for O
mutation O
scanning O
, O
which O
has O
previously O
been O
employed O
for O
the O
diagnostics O
of O
familial B-gene
hypercholesterolemia I-gene
and O
here O
was O
applied O
to O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
sequencing O
. O

This O
approach O
identified O
a O
total O
of O
seven O
heterozygotes O
for O
truncating O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
among O
the O
40 O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
in O
our O
series O
( O
17.5 O
% O
) O
which O
were O
all O
confirmed O
by O
Sanger O
sequencing O
. O

These O
included O
two O
patients B-species
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
c.5266dupC B-mutation
that O
is O
common O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
and O
Germany O
. O

The O
rate O
of O
17.5 O
% O
may O
be O
an O
underestimate O
as O
our O
approach O
would O
not O
have O
identified O
large O
genomic O
deletions O
or O
far O
intronic O
mutations O
. O

There O
was O
no O
association O
with O
earlier O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
, O
however O
more O
mutation O
carriers O
than O
non-carriers O
had O
a O
first-degree O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-disease
or I-disease
ovarian I-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Despite O
this O
trend O
towards O
a O
positive O
family O
history O
, O
two O
of O
the O
seven O
patients B-species
would O
not O
have O
been O
eligible O
for O
mutational O
screening O
under O
current O
guidelines O
though O
one O
of O
the O
two O
would O
have O
been O
detected O
with O
expanded O
criteria O
including O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
younger O
than O
50 O
years O
. O

BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
underrepresented O
in O
our O
study O
compared O
with O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
in O
contrast O
with O
a O
recent O
report O
from O
another O
German O
series O
of O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
who O
were O
also O
unselected O
for O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
and O
family O
history O
. O

The O
latter O
study O
identified O
five O
mutations O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
and O
one O
mutation O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
in O
30 O
German O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
, O
whereas O
we O
have O
identified O
six O
mutation O
carriers O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
one O
for O
BRCA2 B-gene
in O
40 O
German O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
. O

Our O
results O
are O
in O
line O
with O
published O
results O
from O
other O
study O
populations O
that O
consistently O
find O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
than O
in O
BRCA2 B-gene
. O

Furthermore O
, O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutations O
were O
strongly O
associated O
with O
hormone-receptor O
negative O
status O
in O
previous O
analyses O
of O
high-risk O
breast-ovarian B-disease
cancer I-disease
families O
whereas O
most O
BRCA2-mutated O
tumours O
do O
not O
have O
a O
TNBC B-disease
phenotype O
. O

The O
biological O
reason O
for O
the O
different O
outcomes O
remains O
unclear O
, O
given O
that O
BRCA1 O
and O
BRCA2 O
collaborate O
in O
the O
homology-directed O
DNA O
repair O
pathway O
, O
but O
BRCA1 O
may O
exert O
a O
particular O
role O
in O
hormone O
receptor O
expression O
. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
discussed O
that O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carriers O
may O
develop O
TNBC B-disease
later O
in O
life O
than O
BRCA1 B-gene
carriers O
, O
and O
the O
relatively O
old O
age O
at O
diagnosis O
in O
our O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
carrier O
may O
be O
in O
line O
with O
this O
hypothesis O
. O

Genetic O
variation O
at O
other O
loci O
, O
such O
as O
BABAM1 B-gene
( O
MERIT40 B-gene
) O
on O
chromosome O
19q13.1 O
, O
might O
further O
influence O
the O
outcome O
towards O
a O
triple-negative O
phenotype O
. O

Similar O
considerations O
may O
apply O
to O
PALB2 B-gene
, O
encoding O
the O
partner O
and O
localiser O
of O
BRCA2 O
. O

Mutations O
in O
PALB2 B-gene
are O
quite O
rare O
, O
and O
PALB2 B-gene
was O
mutated O
in O
only O
one O
TNBC B-disease
patient B-species
in O
our O
series O
. O

The O
PALB2 B-gene
mutation O
, O
c.758insT B-mutation
, O
was O
identified O
in O
a O
patient B-species
who O
also O
carried O
a O
BRCA1 B-gene
mutation O
, O
c.927delA B-mutation
, O
and O
thus O
may O
provide O
the O
first O
example O
of O
a O
case O
with O
digenic O
mutations O
in O
these O
both O
genes O
. O

Double O
heterozygotes O
have O
previously O
been O
reported O
for O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutations O
and O
, O
in O
one O
study O
, O
appeared O
to O
have O
an O
earlier O
onset O
and O
a O
more O
severe O
disease O
than O
their O
female O
relatives O
carrying O
a O
single O
BRCA1 B-gene
or O
BRCA2 B-gene
mutation O
. O

While O
the O
BRCA1/PALB2 O
double O
heterozygous O
patient B-species
described O
here O
had O
no O
early O
onset O
, O
the O
multifocal O
occurrence O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
her O
positive O
family O
history O
may O
be O
consistent O
with O
a O
severe O

. O

Given O
the O
BRCA1 B-gene

background O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
decided O
which O
of O
the O
genes O
drives O
the O
triple-negative O
phenotype O
in O
this O
patient B-species
. O

Most O
previous O
studies O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
that O
PALB2 B-gene
mutations O
were O
associated O
with O
hormone-receptor O
negative O
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
, O
but O
one O
study O
reported O
that O
carriers O
of O
a O
Finnish O
founder O
mutation O
in O
PALB2 B-gene
had O
triple B-disease
negative I-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
significantly O
more O
often O
than O
other O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
patients B-species
. O

Although O
the O
absence O
of O
additional O
carriers O
in O
our O
series O
argues O
against O
an O
important O
role O
of O
PALB2 B-gene
mutations O
in O
German O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
, O
a O
possible O
link O
between O
PALB2 B-gene
and O
a O
triple-negative O
phenotype O
still O
warrants O
further O
investigation O
. O

The O
BRD7 B-gene
gene O
was O
included O
as O
an O
additional O
candidate O
gene O
for O
TNBC B-disease
because O
BRD7 O
is O
required O
for O
the O
BRCA1-mediated O
transcriptional O
regulation O
of O
the O
estrogen O
receptor O
. O

BRD7 B-gene
has O
been O
described O
as O
a O
tumour O
suppressor O
gene O
that O
is O
frequently O
deleted O
in O
human B-species
breast B-disease
tumours I-disease
harbouring O
wildtype O
p53 O
but O
no O
clearly O
pathogenic O
BRD7 B-gene
germ-line O
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
German O
patients B-species
with O
familial B-disease
breast I-disease
cancer I-disease
, O
thus O
far O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
there O
was O
no O
pathogenic O
mutation O
detected O
in O
any O
of O
the O
40 O
TNBC B-disease
patients B-species
, O
excluding O
a O
prominent O
role O
of O
BRD7 B-gene
in O
the O
genetic O
predisposition O
to O
this O
cancer O
. O

As O
our O
sequencing O
approach O
was O
based O
on O
Sanger O
methodology O
for O
BRD7 B-gene
, O
the O
absence O
of O
mutations O
was O
not O
due O
to O
low O
coverage O
of O
certain O
regions O
. O

Although O
it O
remains O
possible O
that O
large O
genomic O
deletions O
or O
far-intronic O
mutations O
may O
exist O
which O
would O
have O
escaped O
our O
detection O
, O
there O
is O
presently O
no O
evidence O
to O
implicate O
BRD7 B-gene
mutations O
in O
the O
etiology O
of O
TNBC B-disease
. O

In O
summary O
, O
this O
study O
confirms O
in O
a O
hospital-based O
setting O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
of O
high-penetrance O
germ-line O
mutations O
in O
German O
patients B-species

Discussion O
Overall O
, O
we O
have O
found O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
approximately O
10 O
% O
of O

screened O
to O
date O
for O
mutations O
in O
BRCA1 B-gene
and O
BRCA2 B-gene
, O
with O
similar O
percentages O
for O
each O
gene O
. O

The O
frequency O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
identified O
in O
clinicbased O
families O
was O
two-fold O
( O
18.5 O
% O
) O
of O
that O
identified O
in O
the O
population-based O
families O
( O
9.4 O
% O
) O
. O

The O
higher O
frequency O
of O
mutations O
may O
be O
due O
to O
several O
possibilities O
. O

First O
, O
based O
on O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
recruitment O
, O
the O
clinic-based O
families O
have O
a O
stronger O
family O
history O
than O
the O
population-based O
families O
, O
and O
as O
such O
have O
a O
higher O
likelihood O
of O
carrying O
mutations O
. O

Second O
, O
a O
proportion O
of O
the O
clinic-based O
families O
were O
known O
to O
have O
a O
deleterious O
mutation O
at O
enrollment O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
approximately O
41 O
% O
of O
families O
from O
the O
Utah O
Breast O
CFR O
carry O
deleterious O
mutations O
, O
largely O
due O
to O
referral O
of O
families O
from O
a O
research O
study O
in O
which O
mutations O
had O
already O
been O
identified O
in O
the O
families O
. O

The O
frequency O
for O
the O
population-based O
families O
may O
be O
higher O
than O
for O
breast B-disease
cancer I-disease
cases O
in O
general O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
that O
the O

Besides O

we O
identified O

To O
investigate O

we O
examined O
whether O

referred O
at O
lower O

by O
calculating O
the O
fraction O

As O

minimal O
, O
on O

Thus O
, O
in O
this O
study O
, O
those O
women B-species
who O
ultimately O
received O
BRCA1/2 B-gene

were O
of O

and O
so O
potential O

in O

would O
alone O
be O

explain O
the O

but O
the O

suggest O
that O

Though O

the O

that O
the O

be O
slightly O
inflated O
if O

Nonetheless O
, O
it O
is O
standard O

that O

This O
work O
has O
several O
important O
limitations O
. O

As O
a O
non-probability O
( O
opportunity O
) O
sample O
, O
our O
study O
population O
is O
subject O
to O
multiple O
selection O
biases O
that O
may O
influence O
receipt O
of O
testing O
and O
therefore O
bias O
prevalence O
estimates O
. O

Self-reported O
race/ethnicity O
or O
personal/family O
cancer O
histories O
collected O
from O
the O
TRF O
( O
particularly O
among O
high-risk O
persons B-species
) O
are O
subject O
to O
mis-classification O
, O
imprecision O
( O
e.g O
. O
changing O
self-reported O
ethnic O
identity O
over O
time O
) O
, O
and O
cancer O
history O
recall O
bias O
. O

Finally O
, O
because O
family O
structure O
and O
size O
are O
not O
specifically O
queried O
on O
the O
TRF O
, O
individual O
risk O
estimation O
using O
popular O
clinical O
risk O
assessment O
tools O
is O
not O
possible O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
because O
these O
data O
reflect O
empirical O
mutation O
prevalence O
in O
a O
clinically O
relevant O
population O
, O
they O
remain O
valuable O
for O
risk O
assessment O
. O

Several O
comparative O
analyses O
of O
the O
Myriad O

to O
other O
risk O

tools O
have O
been O
published O
in O
recent O
years O

The O
exclusion O
of O
Ashkenazi B-species
Jews I-species
, O
though O
limiting O
our O
ability O
to O
directly O
compare O
findings O
to O
the O
other O
ethnicities O
studied O
here O
, O
is O
nonetheless O
essential O
because O
mutation O
prevalence O
and O
testing O
procedures O
( O
i.e O
. O
use O
of O
the O
founder O
panel O
) O
are O
so O
different O
for O
this O
group O
that O
a O
reasonable O
comparison O
can O
not O
be O
made O
. O

Moreover O
, O
provider O
referral O
thresholds O
for O
testing O
are O
also O
very O
different O
, O
with O
several O
authorities O
recently O
advocating O
population O
screening O
of O
Ashkenazi O
women B-species
. O

We O
excluded O
persons B-species
reporting O
no O
ethnicity O
because O
of O
the O
inability O
to O
draw O
conclusions O
regarding O
shared O
ethnicity O
and O
its O
association O
to O
mutation O
frequency O
, O
and O
those O
reporting O
multiple O
ethnicities O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
enhance O
the O
genetic O

, O
thereby O
increasing O
the O
clinical O
relevance O
of O
conclusions O
to O
a O
subject O
's O
predominant O
ancestral O
background O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
technological O
challenges O
of O
diagnostic O
BRCA1/2 B-gene
DNA O
testing O
are O
many O
, O
including O
the O
dynamic O
process O
of O
VUS O
detection O
and O
reclassification O
. O

More O
recently O

or O

, O
has O

, O

. O

However O
, O
while O

at O
the O

level O
, O
the O
impact O
of O

among O

Nonetheless O
, O
testing O
volumes O
are O
disproportionately O
low O
among O
